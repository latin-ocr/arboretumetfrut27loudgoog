Mar-shall has tha following judicious observations on this subJectz — “ In
foreste and other wastes, whether ublic or appropriated, especially where the
soil is of a deep clayey nature, s will rise spontaneously from seeds that
happen to be dropped, if the seedlin plants should be in situations where they
are defended by underwood or roug bushes-from the bite of asmring am-

The dangerous, and too often, we fear, fatal, defect' caused by the deeayed
