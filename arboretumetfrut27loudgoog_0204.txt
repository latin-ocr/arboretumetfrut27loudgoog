bleck jsck σὺ (Quercus nigre var. ferruginea) are the onlg
-trees to be seen. They survive the confi ratione whic

almost eve year envelope the prairies3 but eir vegetation
is checked y the fire, and they rarely exceed the height of
8 st. or 10 st. (N. Amet. Syl„ i. p. 177.) of all the hickories,
this species is of the slowest growth3 a fect, Michaux adds,
that he has roved, by planting nuts of the several s ies
together, comparing the length of their annual s oots.
It is, also, more liable to be attacked by worms then any
other kind of hicko ’ς especially by the larva of Callidium
flexuosum (fig. 12683, which ests into the body of the tree.

The leeflets are very large, oval-acuminaoe, serrated, and sl' htly down under-
