to give a characteristic appearance to the ν’ -
pods which they border3 and that ita native ·
ocalitiea are, invariably‚ aaudy swamps, and
the margins of lagoona, from Vir nia to
Florida. Dr. Sims has noted at the
zigzag direction and dee eolour of the branchee distinguish the L. geniculata
at first sight ; and that ge could not perceive in its bark any of the aromatic
noent so remarkable in most os the genus, and which is ao clearly perce -
tible in L. Benzbin. Pursh states that the flowers are yellow, and t e
ben-ies lobose and scarlet. We received a plant of this species from Bar-
tram's ffiotanic Gal-den, in 1831: it appeared very distinct3 but, owing
to the crowded state of our garden, and the want of inuictum, it died in the
summer of 1834. Price of planta, at New York, 1 dollar.
