They are there ore well adapted for the arboretam, and for indicating water,
or moist situations, but not for general use in ornamental lantations. Where-
ever willows are planted for the beauty of their blossomS, t e male plant should
be chosen3 because the colour and effect are produced chiefly by the anthera.
Willows in general, Gilpin observes, are trees of a straggling ramification, and
but ill adapted for use in artificial landscape ς “ except as pollards to charac-
terise a marshy country; or to mark, in a second distance, the winding banks
of a heavy, low, sunk river; which could not otherwise be noticed.'’ Some
species, he says, he has admired; and he particularises the S. alba, as having
a “ pleasant, ' ht, sea-green tint, which mixes agreeably with foliage of a
deeper hue.” y far the most beautiful willow, when in flower, is S. caprea,
the catkins of which are not only lar er than those of every other species,
but produced in greater abundance. I enee the great beauty of this willow
in early sprin , and its importance as furnishing food to bees. “ It is in
fiower‚” says r. VValker, speaking with reference to the climate of Edin·
burgh, “ between the l5th of March and the eth of April. During this
time, whenever the thermometer is at or about 420 in the shade, accompanied
with sunshine, the bees come abroad. This is a temperature which osten
occurs3 and, if bees have an opportunity, during that interval, of feeding
three or foui-‘days upon this willow, the hive will be preserved, when, without
this, it would probably perish.'’

As a curious use of the willow, it is mentioned in the Nouveau Du Hamel,
that the roots are more readily changed into brancheS, and the branehes into
roots, than in any other species of a tree. All that is necessary is, to take up
a plant, and bury the whole of the branches in the soil, leaving the whole of
the roots above ground. Poiret, the writer of the article, says he saw this
done, in the neighbourhood of Marseilles, with a great number of plants of S.
alba3 that the larger twisted roots became the principal branches, and pre·
served their general forms; but that the oung shoots produced by these took
the forms and a pearances common to the s ecies in its natural state.

celebrated by an of t e Greek poets, nor by any of the tins, before the
Augustan e. erodotus, however, s eaks of the willow divining-rods of
the ancient cythians; and the use of t e willow in basketwork, dcc„ is men-
tioned by many of the Latin prose writers. Martial alludes to the baskets
(bascaudae) made of willow twigs by the ancient Britons.

The druids are said to have formed huge figures of wickerwork, which, on

t occasions, were filled with criminals, and set fire to (see Sat. Mag„
vol. i. p. 74.): but these basketS, according to Burnet and others, were
formed of the twigs of the oak, and not the willoxv. virgil, Lucan, and
