. Geograph . The oek belongs exclusively to climates temperate either by
their 1 ’ e or their elevation3 the hest of the torrid zone, and the cold of
the frozen zone, being equally unfavourable to its growth. The common
British oak, aster being a long series of years in the Botanic Garden at St.
Vineent’s, never attained a greater hei ht than a shrub, having to contend
with the sultry climate of that island. t never shed its leaves till they were

oek has been, and is, more particularly abundant iu Britain, France, Spain,
8ηά Italy. In Britain, two ιιεἱςιεείιεε only are indigenous ς in France there are
four or five sorts; and in 1 y, Greece, and S , six or seven sorts. The
deciduous oaks are the most prevalent in bo hemispheres3 8ηά the ever-
green kinds are almost exclusively confined to the south of Europe, and to
the temperate regions of Asia 8ηά Africa. The number of sorts described by
botanists 88 species, and as natives of Europe, exceed 303 8ηά 88 natives of
North America, 40. The latter are all comprised between 200 8ηά 480 Ν.

and even in e torrid zone, in situations rendered temperate by their eleva-
tion.

In Britain, the oak is every where indigenous. In Norway it is found at

exclusively Q. Robur L.. including under this name Q. pedunculata 8ηά Q. sessi·

only species 3 but in the south 0 Germany, 88 in Austris, 8ηά in the centre of
France, Q, Uerris abounds; 8ηά in the south of France, Q. Flex, Q. suber,
8ηά some other evei-green species, are found. In Spain, 88 Captain S. E. Cook
informs us, Q. Robur is the most abundant, and almost the only species in
nearly the whole of the northern district of the country; extending through
Numa-e, Guipmcoa, Biscay, maritime Castile, 8ηά Asturiam but it is never
found in the middle region. Q. Flex is the leading tree throughout the whole
of the middle and southern districts of Spain; and the next abundant is
Q. grami‘mtim which requires a drier climate than the former. Q. graminu-
tia produces edible acorna, which Cook states are as good 88, οι· superior
to, 8 chestnut. These, he says, were the edible acorns of the ancients, which
they believed fattened the tunny fish on their from the ocean to the
Mediterraneum. “ These are the bellotas which Teresa, the wife of Sancho
Panza, hered in La Mancha, where they still grow in the greatest persec-

In Italy, Q. Certis and Q. Pex are the prev ⁸ species m the middle
states, Q. pedunculata in the more northern, and . sessiliflora in the king-
dom of Naples. In Greece 8ηά Asia Minor, we have Q. E‘sculus, with the
others before mentioned; 8ηά Q. AE‘gilo , Q. Tati-vin, Q. infectoria, and some
