:ivs to reviveys teste for the art. The first engva on woog, and utp to the'
time of Bewick, or nearly so, were accustomed to have the trunks os e trees
on which they were to engreve sawn up into planks, and to cut out the en-
“ with s knife, or other tools, on the side of the grain: but, about
ffl’s time, or before, the practice of cutting the trunk across into sections
about l in. in thickness wes adopted3 and the vin were cut on the
wood, across the grain, with tools which will be er r described. The
adven of this mode are, that mucli finer lines can be produced3 that the
e ffilock will give a much ter number of impressions3 and thet it
befar more durable. The fo owers of Bewick produced some beautiful
