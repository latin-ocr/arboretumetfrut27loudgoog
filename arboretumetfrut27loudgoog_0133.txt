most os them have been selected by nuraerymeu from their seed-beda. Any
one, Baudrillart remarks, whohas ever obaerved a bed ofseedling elma, must
have noticed that some havelargeleavea, and some small οπως some are
early, and some late; some have amooth bark, and some rough [ιω-ξς and
some aoft leaves, and others very rough ones. Some varietiea are higher thau

planta that have been long submittcd to the cultivation of man. The caree
thu are bestowed upon them, the diffoeent situations in which they are placed,
and the different kinds os treatment which they receive, appear to change
their native habits. (See Diei. des Ean-2· et For-ets, ii. p. 460.) The uan-
tity of the timber of the several varietiea differs aa much aa the aize o the
leaves and the habit of growth. In some varietiee, auch aa U. c. vimi-
nalis, it is of no value, from the alenderueea of the trunk ς in othere, the tree
ie subject to decay at the οἰοίιιιι of the brauchea, the bark to split into long
thiu stripe, and the interior of the trunk to rot. The most valuable varietiea
for cultivation aa timber trees are, U. c. stricta, U. macutifolia, U. c. alba, and
U. c. latifolia. We shall first give the names of the rincipal varieties of the
eommon English elm ‚which are to be found in ritiah nun-serien and,
next, the names of those which are said to be cultivated in France. We might
have doubled the number of these varietie23 aud we should have felt 'usti-
fied in including among them U. auberdsa, and perhaps some other inda
which we have treated aa apeciea5 for there is, m truth, no certainty aa
to what are species and what varietiee in elma.

1 U. ιι] vulgae-iga campestris Hort. Dur.—-Very twi ς pale amooth bark ς
of irregular owt in some planta, with almost orizontal branchee,
where no o era are near to force the shoots upwards. ln some
coila, it ia v subject to decay at the joints. Τὴε bark is leaden·
coloured whi e young, s litting into long thiu strips with age. A
bad variety to cultivate or timber.

1 U. c. 2 Iahfilia Hort. has broader leaves than the species, and ex-
pande them very early in ring. There ia a tree of thia variety in
the London Horticultural ciet 's Garden, which, in 1824, after
being 10 years planted, was 17 st. igh.

Loevea ahinmg, and doubl and deeply serrated, bearing a very near
resemblance to those of . effusa. A valuable timber tree.

’Ξ U. c. 4 amalfi-'lia Masta-s. — Growth, during its early stages, very like the
last, but stronger. The leaves, in old specimena, more tapering, and
the branchea more penduloua. The young leaves do not justnfy ita
name. Bark like the last. This appears very common in some
parta of Essent, Suffolk, and Norfolk. Also a ood timber tree.

able timber trees of the sanan-leaved kinds. Growth very rigid.
