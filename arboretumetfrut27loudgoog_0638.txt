different hue which it assumes in autumn ς the colour of Q. coccinea being
alwa s a bright scarlet, or yellowish red, of more or less intensity3 and that of

’ tinguish it from that of Q. tinc-
toris: the only constant difference
is, that the kernel of the nut is
always yellowish in Q. tinctoria, and ‘
always white in Q. coccinea. The
difference between the scarlet oak
and the red oak appears to be about
as great as that which exista between
two ve distinct varieties of apple and pear: for example, the non 'l and
the gol en pippin, or' the jargonelle and the summer bergamot. ese oaks
are not, however, on that account the less worthy of being kept quite distinct3
for it must always be recollected, that some pf the finest planta in every de·

Geography, Hister-y, 6¹0· The scarlet oak, says the younger Michaux, is first
aeen in the vicinity of Boston3 but it is most abundant in New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and the upper art of the Carolinas and Georgia. In the northern
states, it is osten confound with Q. rubra, and in those of the south with Q.
falcata. The scarlet oak was one of those discovered by Banister, and included
