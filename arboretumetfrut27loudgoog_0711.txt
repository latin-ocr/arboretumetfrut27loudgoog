Other Britislt Varieties or Van-infinum In some, beech woodo, trees are

is clesner and freer of black knots, end also more plenssntly worked than
theswhiteg but it corrupte much sooner in the bark when cut down. This
variety of beech, when properly trained,” he continues, “ is, probably, the
most profitshle hard wood that we can raiae: when planked,1t bends plen-
ssntly under the shipwright to the curvatur-e of the vessel’s side. The tree
is also much su ‘or in size and grece of outline to the white.’' (On Nav.

Tha„ p. 49.) his variety ought to be sou t out in beech woods, or in
plantatione, and the mast collected from it or propagation: it ought also

to be rop ed hy grafting or.budding, as nn expenment to t whether

the colom-moad can be continued without reference to the so' on which

the stock grows. Mitchell says theresre two sorts of beech, the black and
the white wooded3 but he knows no sort of botanical distinction between
them. He never met, he adds, ‘⁸ with five trees of the black beech on any

estnte‚’' and, therefore, concludes that the colour of the wood is merely a

varintion resulting from soil.

Beech‚ Amet-,3 is generally considered by botanists as identicel with the
common European beech. This it very probabl is; but, from the
figure in Michaux, and the deseri tion ‘ven by im of the wood, it
appears to us somewhnt different rom t e species. In North Ame-
nea, it forms one of the tallest and most majestic trees of the forest,
nhounding in the middle, western, end southern statem but most
abundant in the middle and western states, and composing large
messes in Genessee, Kentuck , end Tenuessee, in deep molst soil,
nnd in n cool atmosphere. ’Τ e trunks of the trees are frequently
8 ft., 9 ft„ and ll st. in circumference, and more than 100ft. high.
The trec is less branchy than the F. ferruginea, or red beech of
Americn3 and the perfect wood bears but a small proportion to the
sep, frequentl occupying only 3 in. in a trunk 1 ft. 6 in. in diameter.
The wood o the white beech is little valued in America, even for
fuel ς and the bark is used for tanning, but is little esteemed; and,
therefore, in point of utility, the tree cannot be recommended for
culture in Europet but, if it should prove distinct from the common
beech, it well deserves introduction ns nn ornamental variety.
