in ’cular districts of very poor soil, where, alone or mingled

wit the bear οὐ (Q. Banlsteri), it sometimes covers tracts of more

Α than 100 acres inextent. It was introduced in 18233 but, is rarely

to be met within lantations. Pursh states that it is highly om
mental when in ull bloom3 and Michaux observes that it might

probably be cultivated along with Q. Banisteri for its fruit, which,

as before observed, is very sweet. From the small'size of the plant,.
this variety is well deserving of culture for suburban or small
villa gardens, and miniature arboretums.

white Oak.-'—Leaves almost sessile,

obtusely oval, bluntly toothed3

downy beneath. (Michx.) The

swamp white oak, in Amenca, aa s

the younger Michaux, is a beau ⁸ l

tree. more than 70 ft. high,.of a

vigorons habit of growth, and with

luxuriant foliage. The leaves are

from δίη. to Sin. long, and 4in. 4

broad3 entire towards the base,

which is attenuated and wedge-

shaped3 but dilated and coarsely

toothed for two thirds of their length.

The tree is distinguished, vyhen full grown, by the regnarkahle

white. With the exception of the district of “ e, and e marn-
time parts of the southern provinces,- Michaux informs us that this
oak is diffused throughout the whole of the United States. ‘⁸ In
comparison, however, with several other species, it is not common,
being found only on the αἶα of swamps, and in wet places exposed
to inundations,and notin e foresta at .” It generally grows in
&mmmmm mm& ...alffius
as the alder and oplar. This species appears to have been dis·
covered by the el er Michaux, who has figured a leaf of it under
the name of Q. P. tomentosa3 but when it was introduced into
Britain is uncertain, though, in all probability, it would be about the
same time as Q. P. monticola, viz. in 1800. The wood is strong,
elastic, and heavier than that of the white oak. In full-grown trees,
the grain is fine and close, and the pores are not visible to the naked
eye ι it splits easily, and in a straight line; and, accordingto Michaux,
it is estes-ed next in quality to the American white oak, though,
from its rareness, it is but seldom employed for economical pur-

· zogdes. There is a tree of this species in the arboremm at Maura.
