ever, has the remarkable property of being more durable when it is young
than when it ia old3 the sap or outer wood very soon changiug into heart

that the annual layers of the wood not being freely united together by unns· ,

the disease which is called, in Franco, cadmum-e (literally,d1alhng) This
disesse cannot be discovered till the tree ns cut down3 when ιι is found to be
open at the hmwithrentsmdisting from itseentretowards the circum·
ference3 in consequence of which the wood is unfit for being sawn into either
planks or besms, and ean only be employed for laths or fencmg. Bosc found
thatofthetrunksofSOchestnuttrees, about lst.indiameter, which hehad
seen cut down and squared in the forest of Montmorency, there were 20 in
the diseased state above described. Hence, he says, we seldom find any trunks
os old chestnut trees, because this peculiarity in their organisation not only
unfita them for every purpose of carpenti-y or joinery, but occasions them to
dec-y from the centre outwards. To us ιι appears probable that this organ-
isation, by lessening the communication of the Juicee of the tree m a horizonta!
direction, may also be the cause why the sap wood so soon becomes hear-t
wood. Bethatasitmay‚it is clearthatallthat hasbeen said in savourof
planting the cheetnut for its timber can only rank, in int of authority, with
what has been said respecting plauting the locust for tflg same purpose. The
French writers state that chestnut wood is a good deal used for makin wine-
casksg a circumstance notieed by Rapio, in his poem entitled The Gorgen:-

“ With close-grain'd chestnut, 'nod ot nova-m use,

Wine is said to ferment in chestnut casks more alowly, and be less likely to
evaporatez it also does not contract any unpleasant taste. There is scarcely
any wood, according to Du Hamel, which makes better hoops‚ aa these reciet
the dry rot in cellara where every other kind of wood decays. Du Hamel
observes, at the same time, that chestnut wood decays speedily, when it ie
subjected alternately to drynese and moiature. (Eaploo't de Bois, p. 296.)
varennes de Fenille, on the other hand, states that, m La Boesee, posta of
chestnut are preferred to those of every other wood for forming the supporta
of huts, notwithstanding these poste are subjected to the action of alternate
humidity and dryness. The wood of the cheetnut is not much approved of
as fuel ε it throwe out sparks, and smoulders in the fire rather than flamea;
though it gives out a great deal of heat. The charcoal, though good, ie not
of the first quality: it rs inferior to that of the oak for domestic purposee, and
