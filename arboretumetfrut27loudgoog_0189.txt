side of St. Joeeph’s Chapel, a miraculous walnut tree, which never budded
forth before the feast of St. Barnabas (that is the llth of June), and on that

by French authors3 stom which it appears that, in the north of France, and in
eold countries generally, the walnut does not bud or gmft easily by any mode3
but that, in the south of France, and north of Italy, it may be budded or
grafted by different modes, with success, At Metz, the Baton de Techoudy
