Brussels where, in consequence of his suggestions to the local authorities, in
was foun necessary to cut down from 20 to 30 large trees attacked by
Scolytus destructor in the Park, and from 50 to 60 ounger ones in the
boulevards), 8ηά also during a tour in the north of rauce this summer

state of decay indicated by M. Audouin as arising from the attacks of the
scolyti simply for food; and great numbers of these in which the semidea,
having found them sufficiently debilitated, had deposited their egga, and given
birth to numerous broods of larvae, which had caused them to be either dead

fallen victims to the ravagcs of Scdlytus destructor, ns well as 50,000 young
oaks in the Bois de Vincennss, near Paris, which it has been recenti y necessary
to cut down in consequence of the attacks of another insect of the same tribe,
S. pygmae³us. The practical directions to which it leads, in all cases where
there is reason to suspect the presence of acolyti, are very simple, 8ηά may
be briefly expressed as follows τ -

l. The first thi to be done ia, to pare away the exterior rough bark with
a cooper‘s okes ave, or other convenient toolz this admits of a distinct
inspection o the actual state of the trees, which, if there is no trace in the
inner bark either of small holes in old trees, or of those superficial furrows
which the scolyti make for food in young trees (and which may be distin-
guished from the natural crevices in the bark by their dark·coloured and dead
malfffih)⁹ may:3 bg pronounced to be in a sound and healthy state, 8ηά requiring
no er a n on.

2. 1f the inner burk exhibits either of the appearanees just mentioned, the
next thing to be ascertained is, whether the female has already deposited her
egga in it, and if it contain the larvae of the acolyti: to know which, it is

cara Τ ose trees which, though pierced with exterior su cial holes or
ffirrows, have no larvae in them, are such as have been atta ed by the seolyti
for food only3 and,if they be carefully brushed over with coal tar, the smell of
which is highly offensive to the erfect scol ti, there is every probability that
they will be secure from the uture attae s of the females3 8ηά that the
repetition of the same process in the spring, for a year or two, would enable
thern to resume their vigour, and to become health trees; for the fiiture fate
of which,if‚ at the same time, the entire removal of al the trees actually diseased
has been attended to, there would be no need for apprehension. It is in this
way, as we are informed by Mr- Spence, that a great number of the young elm
trees in the boulevards at Brussels, brought into an incipient stage ofdebility
by the attacks of tbe scolyti for food, but not yet attacked by the females,
were treated in the spring of 1836 with every prospect of 8 successful resultg
though, of course, some years must elapse before any absolute deductione can
be drawn stom the experiment. 'l'he above most important incarnation was
communicated to us by Mr- Spence in December, 1836.

Recorded Elms. Evelym to prove thatthe elm attains “ a prodigious growth
in less than a person's agess’ mentions a tree which he had seen, “ planted by
the hand of a countess, hving not long since, which was near 12 st. in compens,
8ηά of a height pro rtionable.” He mentions elma, “now standing in g
numbers which wil bear almost 3st. square for more titan 4ost. in height.”
