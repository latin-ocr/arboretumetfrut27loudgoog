is called by the ortu uese the tree of paradise, is also remarkable
for the fragrance of its b'iossoma, which are produced in great abundance
in May, and perfume the air for a considerable distance around. For
this reason it·is annost desirable tree for ajaugn or shrubbery. There

diameter. In the Levant, the fruit of the cultivated varieties, E. h. orientalis
and dactyliformis, is made into preserves, and also dried like pistachia nuts.
The plant requires a sheltered situation, and, to attain any aize, must be
planted in a good soil. Price of planta, in the London nurseries, 2³. ed.

γαν-ἐθάσι. Bieberstein, in his Fe. Taur. Caua, i. p. 112, 113„ as quoted in Bm.
et Schult. Syst. and Bot. Reg„ has comprehended under one species several
sorum, some of which are treated osas specifically distinct by Linnaeus and
other botanists. He gives Ε. hortensis as the name of the specieS, which
he considers to exist under the four following forms: -

1 E. Ιι. 1 ίῇὃὶἰα Bieb., E. angustifolia L.- Leaves lanceolate,

as large as that of a jujube, and used in the dessert in Persia, where
it is called zinzeyd. The flowers are more flagrant than those of
E. h. angtmtifolia. (Lindl. in Bot. Reg„ t. 1156„ and in Nat. Syn.
