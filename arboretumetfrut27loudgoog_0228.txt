to remain uncut sor such a l h of time, the stools become stronger and more

of very considerable value. ’ (Ibid., p. 332.)
· (Μαίης. The proper season for cutting basket willows is the autumn,
immediatel after the fall of the leaf. The advantage of cutting at this
season is, t at the buds which are left to produce the shoots for the succeed-
ing crop immediately begin to swell, and grow in strength during the winter,
and, consequently, they make much earlier and stronger shoots in the following
spring. Immediately after cutting the rods, they are tied up in bundles, each
generally about Βῆ. 9 in. in girt, and if they are not intended to be used green,
that is with the bark on, they 'are set on their thick ends iu standing water,
to the depth of 3in. or 4iu. Here they remain during winter and spring,
till the shoots hegin to sprout, which generally hap ens, m the neighbourhood
of London, about the end of February, when t ey are ready to be peeled.
Sometimes it happens that osiers are cut with the leaves on, in which case they
should never be tied up in bundles, on account of the fermentation that would
be produced by binding them closely together in that state 3 but the rods
should be set up thinly and loosely on end, their tops leaning against a rod

bundle. Three bands are bound round each bundle; viz. one towards each

In formin their bundles, baskevmakers tie up a small zirmful (which thegy call a
calf )‚ anf place it in the middle of the bottom of the bundle, so that the ends
extend about lft. beyond the bottom, and tie it up in this state. By lifting
up the bundle a few times, and letting it fall on its base to the ground, the
ealf is driven up, and, acting as a wedge, tightens the bundle. Α machine
called a dumb-boy, made of wood and rope, is used by some purchasers for
com ressing the greatest possible number of rods into a bundle. Another
mac ine, called a cow, which is made of iron, has a still greater power of
compression than the dumb·boy. The usual price for common reen osiers,
in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk, is lc. ed. per bundle. About ndon, the
bundles are of the same size, and the price varies from 21. to 3⁸. per bundle.
Dte operation qf Peeliag is very simple, and is commonly done by infirm or
old men or women, at so much a bundle. The apparatus for peeling consists
of two round rods of iron, nearly fiin. thick, l ft. 4in. long, and tapering a
