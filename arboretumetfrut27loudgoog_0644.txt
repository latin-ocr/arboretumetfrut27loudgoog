lowish brown, beginning with
the petiole. This oak is nearly
as extensively distributed in
North America as the white
oak3 and, exce t in the district

of Maine, an the northern

 

pert of New Hampshire, Ver-

mont, and Tennessee, this spe-

cies is found throughout the

United Stater„ on¹ both sides

ot the Alleghanies3 and it is

everywhere called the black

oak, except in some parts of

New England, where, according to Dr. Brown (Syl. Amen), it is called the
yellow oak. It flourishes in Maryland, and in some parts of Virginia, where
the soil is lean, gravelly‚ and uneven ς audit generally will grow in a poorer soil
than the white oak. This oak was one of those enumerated by the elder
Michaux, as being advisable to introduce into France, and of which he sent
seeds to that country in 1786 (see p. 142.)·; notwithstanding which, it does

this country, might possib! become of use for its burk.

Proper-ties and Uret, ’ἶῚιε wood, though course-grained and porous, is
much more esteemed for strength and durability than that of any other Ame-
rican oak of biennial fructification. In Phuadelphia, it is employed in buil ' ς
and, in most parts of the northern stateS, it is used as a substitute for e
white oak, whenever that tree is scarce3 and a large proportion of what are
called the best red oak staveS, which are used, in Canania and the west Indiezz,
to form casks for flour, salted provisione, and molasseS, are made of the wood
of this tree. The bark is extensively used in tannin33 for which it is well
adapted‚ as it is producedin great abundance, and is rich in tanniu. The only
inconvenience ie, that shoes made of leather tanned with it are apt to im
a'yellow tinge to the stockinge. Thia colour, however, may be discharges&
subjecting the leather to a particular roce85, when it is thought worth while
to incur the expense. The most l product of this oak is the uercitron,
which is much used in both America end England for dyein 3 an which is
not only equal to woad in the brilliancy of the yellow produce , but is so much
stronger, that Dr. Bancroft states that one part of quercitron yields as much
colouring matter as 8 or 10 parts of woad. The colouring matter is con-
tained in the inner bark, a decoction of which forms a brownish yellow dye,
which may be rendered deeper by alkalies, and lightcr by acide. A solution of
alum causes a small portion of the colouring matter to fau in a deep yellow
precipitate3 and solutions of tin afford a more abundant precipitem, of a
brighter hue. To dye wool, it is sufficient to boil the quercitron with an equa!
