Descr' tion. The common mulberry is generally a low, much-branched
tree, wit a thick rough bark, and broad beart-shaped leaves, which are un·
y serrated, and very rou . The fruit is large, of a dark pu le, very

w olesome, and agreeable to t e palate. The mulberry tree is remar ble for
the slowness of its growth3 and also for being one of the last trees to deve-
lope its leaves, though it is one of the first to- ripen its fruit. In Britain, the
tree alwags assumes something of a dwarf or stunted character, spreading into

300 ears old, and some at Oxford and other laces being supposed to be of
near y usl antiquity. It is also wonderful y tenacious of ltfe3 the roots
of a blac mulberry, which had lain dormant in the ground for twent ·four
years, being said, aster the expiration of that time, to have sent up s oots.

Geggrophy. The common, or black, mulberry is generali supposed to be
s native of Persia, where there are still messes of it foun in a wild stateg
though the date of its introduction into Europe is unknown3 and though it is

History. The blaclt mulberry has been known from the earliest records of
antiquity. Itis twice mentioned in the Biblu viz. in the Second Book of
Samuel, and in the Psalms. The same difficulty, however, exists in σιώ)
its history distinctly from that of the white mulberry, as in its geographyg an
it is only when spoken of as a fruit tree, or when its colour ts decidedly
mentioued, that we can be sure which species is meant. Ovid, however,
evidently points out the black mulberry as the one introduced in the story of
Pyramus and Thisbe 3 and Pliny seems also to allude to it, as he observes
that there is no other tree that has been so neglected b the wit of man,
either in grafting or giving it names3 an observation which ffolds to the
present day respecting the black mulberry, as it has only one ’ g variety,
or rather variation, and uo synon ς whereas there are numerous varieties
of M. alba. Pliny adds, “ Of affuge cultivated trees, the mulberry is the
last that buds, which it never does until the cold weather is past3 and it is
therefore called the wisest of trees. But, when it begins to ut forth buds,
it despatches the business in one “zht'and that with so much orce, that their
breaking forth may be evidently eard.” (Book xvi. c. 25.) The black
mulberry was first brought to England in {5483 when sometrees were planted
at Syon, one, at least, of which (fig. 1222.) is still in existence. Others say
that the first mulberry tree planted in Ensshnd was in the garden at Lam·
beth Palace, b Cardinal Pole, about 1555. e tree is mentioned by Tusser,
and also by rard, who describes both the black and the white mulberry
as being cultivated in his time. The royal edict of James 1.. about 1605,
recommendi the cultivation of silkworms, and offering packets of mulberry
seeds to all w o would sow them, no doubt rendered the tree fashionsble, as
