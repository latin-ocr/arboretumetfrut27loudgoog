Descriptio& ᾂσ. 'rhe Ontario poplar bears a close neral resemblance to
the baisarn plarx it has the rigid fastigiate habit o that tree, its fine fra-
ce, suffita property of throwing up numerous suckers ς but it differs

The buds are covered with the same balsamic
substance as those of P. balsamifera3 and
the leaves are of the same fine yellow colour ,Α

preserve, at all suffice of their growtb, the
same shape. The oliage, when mature, is
tusted‚ and of a dark green3 the dis sition
of the branches is somewhat rigid an irregu-
lar 3 which last circumstance preventa the
foliage from massing well together, and gives
the tree rather an inelegant appearance. The
trunk is covered with a smooth greenish
bark, which becomes darker with age3 the
wood is θοῆς and, like that of the baisam poplar, is chiefly valnable for
producing potash. Michaux never found the tree in foreste in Amal-ica,
nor was he able to discover where it ‘was indigenous; but he found it
