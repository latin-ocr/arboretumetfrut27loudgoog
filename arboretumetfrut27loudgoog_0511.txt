was considered as an omen that some great missortune would besall the
nation. According to Davies's Celtic Benearchee and Inquiaey into the Mytko-
Ioqut‘theDndds‚the letree wa's considered as the next sacred tree to
the οὐ, and orchards o it were always planted near a grove of druids' οὐκ.
This was also favourable to the production of the mistletoe, as it grows abun-
dantly on the apple trec, and might be easily ropagated by birds, or any other
accidental mode of trampo ⁸ the seed. e we l·known chorus of ‘⁶ Hey
derry down,’' according to rosessor Burnet‚ was a druidic chaunt, sig-
nifying‚ lita-ally, ‘⁴ In a circle the oak move around.’' criminals were tried
under an oak tree3 the judge being laced under the trec, with thejury beside
him, and the culprit placed in a circ e made by the chief druid's wand. The
Saxona also held their national meetings under an οὺς and the celebrated
conference between the Saxone and the BritonS, after the invasion of the
former, was held under the oaks os Dartmoor. The wood of the oak was
appropriated to the most memorable uses: King Arthur’s round table was
made of it, as was the cradle of Edward 111„ when he was born at Caernarvon
Castleg this sacred wood being chosen, in the h of conciliating the feelings
of the welch, who still retained the prejudices o their enecatam, the ancient
Britons. It was considered unlucky to cut down any celebrated tree ε and
Evelyn gravely relates a story of two men who cut down the Vicar’s Oak, in
Surrey3 one lmiffihgffe' and the other breaking his leg, soon after.

English dool trec, is a low pollard-like trec, with nothing remarkable in its

appearance, though the associatione connected with it are extremel intereat· ’

exactly three centuries ago, the abbot and prior of Woburn, the vicar of

Pud ' n, and ‘⁴ other *contumacium persons,’' were hanged b order of
Henry ΙΙΙ. Dodds, in his Olim-la Histoi-y o Ε land, states t R
Hobbs, the abbot of Woburn at that time, “ nob y ’ ' ⁰ to compromise is

conscience for a pension, as most of his brethren did, and as malz others who
do not wear a eowl do at the present day, resolutely denied the ing’s supre-
macy, and refused to surrender his sarcedotal rights. For this contumacious

conduct, he was, in 1537, together with the vicar ofPuddin on, in this count

tree in sront of the monastery, which is standin in the present day [17422 .
