appears to have been equally the case in Euro in modern times 3 gardeners,
even so late as the time of the Commonweal , being called by Commenius
pleachers (See Joenua Tn'fingun’e, Oxford edit.) About the middle of the
seventeenth century, the taste for vei-dant sculpture was at its height in
E land3 and, about the beginning of the eighteenth, it ufforded a subject of
rail ery for the wits of the day, soon afterwards beginning to decline. There
are some humorous on the subject in the Gneo-dian, and other contem-
porary works. The ο owing lines will give a good idea of a topiary garden :—

In modern Gardening, the tree box forms onejof our most valuable evergreen
shrubs or low trees. It is more particularly eligible as an undergrowth in
ornamental plantationem where, partially shaded by other trees, its leaves
take a deeper green, and shine more conspicuously. Next to the holly, it

said that its leaves are particularly poisonous to camels. It is also asserted by
many authors that box trees are never cropped by cattle ς and that the Corsican
honey is rendered isonous from the bees feeding on the flowers of the box.
