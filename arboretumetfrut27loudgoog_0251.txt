hyena of Smith ΞΒ a variety of S. nlbra3 an states that both are common

about Erlangen‚ where there is also another variety, which he regards as a

hybrid between S. rssbra and S. viminalis. The leaves os this kind, even

when adult, have their under sursace covered with a dense silky down like
those of S. viminali„ the young nhoote bear stipules the length of the
tiole, like those of S. stipularis ; and the catkina resemble those of S. rilbra.
ere are planta of S. rtlbra at Hackney, Goldworth, Woburn, Henfield, and

Flitwick. When the lanta of this species are cut down,they send out

shoots from δὴ. to 8 . in length; and it is consequentl one of the most

valuable osiers in cultivation, for banda, crateS, basketwor or wickerwork,
and even small hoops. ·
