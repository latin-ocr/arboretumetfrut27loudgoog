trunk, reaching to the height of 60st. or vost. The buds, like those of J. nigra
and J. cinerea, are smooth 8ηά uncovered. The leaves are from l2in. to 18 in.
in length; the etioles are
somewhat ang-alliu and the
leaflets are sessile, and com·
posed of 6 or ’7 pairs, ter-
minated by a petiolated odd
one, which is somewhat
smaller than the pair imme-
diately precedin it. The
leafleoe, on flouris 'ng trees,
are from 2 in. to 3 in. long,
ovate, serrated, and re·
markable for the circular
form of the upper edge,
while the lower one is less
rounded. The main rib is
not exactly in the middle
of the leaflet. The nuta,
which are usually abundant,
are contained in 8 husk
