152.) M. Robiquet (as quoted in the
Athenoeum for Apul 15. 1837) has been
nnaking various experimenta on the tan-
mn and galhc acld contained in gall
nuts. One of the most remarkable re-
sults obtained by him is, a knowledge
of the great difference of time which it ‚
takes to transsorm pure tannin into
gallic aeid, and to produce it from the
entire nut. Eight uionths will not cotn-
plete the former operation, while one
month is sufficient for the latter ς a
proof that the gall nut contains princi-
ples, perhaps gum or rather munilege,
