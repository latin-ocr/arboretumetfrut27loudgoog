states, takin the banks of the Delaware forits northern boundary‚
8ηά those o the Savannah forits southern. It is, however, very
thinly disseminated, and is frequently lost sight of for several days'
journey, even in those states where it is most plentiful. From its
comparative rareness, it does not appear to have been applied to any
uses in the arts3 and Michaux says that the pores in its wood are

neath. (Moehae.) The dwarf chestnut oak is

one of the smalleet of the genus, ae, according

ιο the younger Michaux, it rarely exceeds

30in. in height3 though Pursh says lt grows to

the height of 3 st. or 4 st. The leaves are onl-

aeuminate, regularly, but not deeply, dentated,

of 8 light green above, and whitish beneeth.

The acorns are enclosed, for about one third of

their len , in scaly sessile cups: they are of *ων

and very sweet. Nature seems ιο have sought to com ensate for the

diminutive size of this shrub by the abundance of its ἱξιιὶιε the stem,

which is sometimes no bigger than a quill, is stretched at full length

upon the ground by the weight of ita thickly clustering acorna.
