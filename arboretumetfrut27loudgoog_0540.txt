Cin-imm vire-unumve: connected with Oak Trees. ⁰ r Rooke mentions
that, in cutting down some trees in the wood of Bir or Birchland, in
Sherwood Forest, letters, &c., were found within the wood of several oaks,
marking the king’s reign. In one tree, cut down in 1786, were found J. R„
su sed to ⁰ mfy James 110ος and in another, W. M„ with 0 crown‚ for

1 liam and ffim and in a third, Joh. Rex, with several marks something
like the old erown in prints of King John; but Major Rooke observes that
the crown is not sufficiently made out for him to insert it as a fact. The
letters were about 111. withm the tree‚ and above l ft. 110111 the centre. Cruci-

11κο0, images, &c., have been found in similar situations, enclosed in the like
manner. Osten dead branches of trees, when small, are thus enclosed, and

John Clarke mentions that the horn of 0 large deer was found embedded in
the 110οη of 011 mk, which was discovered on cutting down the 110ος 01111 that
it was found fixed in the timber by large iron cramps: it seems, therefore,
that it had been first fastened on the outside of the tree, which, in growing
afterwards, had enclosed the horn.” (Amoen. Quer.)

Raimg Oak Dect. 411 trees, especially those of great height, in insulated
situations, condense the water vapour of the atmosphere3 and, when this
is very abundant, it falls from t e leaves in drops like rain. The elm and the
poplar as already mentioned, p. 1662), being tall trees, afford familiar illustra-
tions o this3 but the oak, also, occasionally exhibita the same phenomenon.
