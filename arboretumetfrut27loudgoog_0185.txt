In Efflm' formerly, Evelyn informs us, ‘⁴ there were considerable plant-
ations this tree, particularly on the 0110111 hills os 80110 .” He instances
those of Sir Richard stidolph, near Leatherhesd3 Sir bert Clayton, at
Morden, near Godstone‚ once belonging to Sir John Evelyn3 and the country
about Car-shalton. During the late war, great numbers of walnut trees,
in different parts of England, wei-e cut down for the urpose of supplying
gun-stoek83 till the price os walnut timber rose so ' (6001. having been
given for one large tree ‚ as to induce its im rtation from the Continent,
and the substitution o the wood os the ack walnut of Amet-ica. In

111 for walnut wood b the cabinet-mahen, and when wood· sor gun-

states as a forest trec. Walnuts for the table 010 now annually imported from
France and Spain ς 01111 pay a duty of 2-1. per bushel. The quantity imported
in 1831 was 23578 bushels, of which 160 bushels were exported, and the
remainder retained for home use. In 1832, only about two thirds of the

uantity were imported3 but 551 bushels were exported. (M‘C'ulloch's Coram,
Ba„ p. 1218.) This variation, in respect to the importation and exportation
11131· ,1110 walnuts, is owing to the 101101101ιο 111 1110 crop on the Continent and in

Evelyn says, is held to make the better-coloured work3 but the older, and
especially the firm and close timber about the root, is best 011ορ1011 for “ flaked
and cambleted works.” Those trees, he says, which have small and thick-
shelled fruit produce better timber than the large-fruited or thiu-shelled kinds.
Evelyn strongly recommends walnut timber for household furniture, utensile,
and wainscotmg walls, “instead of the more vulgar beech‚ subject to be weak
