to the subject, discovered that which 1 ought tonghave perceived half a
century sooner; namely, that Nematus capra, favoured by the peculiar lo-
cality, was the cause of all this devastation. The spot is low, meist, shut
in by wood, and very near the southern limit of England. The species os
willow lanted was chiefly one of those with broad leaves, woolly underneath
(probabe S. caprea L.). Tite warmth of the situation, and ‘the nidus for eggs
afforded by these woolly leaves, were, 1 presume‚ the combined cause of the
insect being so remarkably attracted to this spot. Some of the plants were
of a species with smooth narrow leaves( robably S. trifindra L.)= these es-
eaped much longer than the others, but sti 1 they did not escape eventually, as
they were also attacked by another caterpillar. 1 introduced both red and
blaek ants, and put some os the caterpillars into their nests; but the ants
disregarded them altogether. Having, although thus slowly, ascertained the
true state of things, the ground was once more cultivated, aud was planted
with apple trees. As there ha ns to be no insect there which much attacks
these, they thrive very well. he distance at which le trees are planted
is, also, less favourable to the propagation of vermin. ve communicated
all this detail in order to show the unportance to individuale of attending to
such seemingly trifling matters. Many a plantation, δια, fails in an apparently
inex lieable manner. Δ scientific investigation would, in numerous cases,

undergo the change to their last and pe ect form.

The leaves of some species of willows are also infested with galls, which
are the productiori, not ol‘ a species of Cynipidae, but of one of the Tenthredi-
nidae ( efflatus intercus Panzer Fauna Ins. Germ„ 90. fig. 11.; or the
Tenthredo salicis pentfindrae Villars . The larvae of this insect, instead of
feeding externally upon the leaves o the willow, is enclosed in a gall, u on the
substance of which it subsiste, and within which it undergoes al its c anges.
