the desired perfficfion for the manufacture of corks3 and, therefore, it is sold to
the fisboemen for their acts, and for different other inferior uses. At the end

taking the berk off the common oak. The cork, when first removed

breedth‚ and the diameter of the trec from which they ave been
taken. To make them lose this curved form, aster being scraped

blazing fire till the surface becomes scorched3 aster which they ere laid

This gives em a set, or Ἔπη, which they retain ever afterwardsg 8ηά thus
they become in 8 litter state, not only for packing 8ηά transportation, but for
being manufactured. The slight charring which the scorching produces has
the effect of closing the pores of the cork, and giving it what the ooth-cutters
call nerve- The best cork is not less than 12 in. in thickness: it is sup le,
clastic, neithertwoqdy nor pomus, and of 8 reddish colour- Yellow σοι-ἓ is
considered of inferior quahty3 and white ceth, which has not been charred
on the surface, as the worst. The duty on manufactus-ed cork, M‘Culloch

trees at the first 8ηά second disbarkings were admitted duty free, it would be
found of great use in lining the walls and roofs of cottsges, and for covering
their floors, and various other uses, which would contribute much to the com-

fort of the poorer classes, independently of lining the summer and fishing
houses of the rich, as already suggested.

The tree attains 88 large a size m Britain 88 it does in Spain, and might
probably produce cork for the above pun-posen, if it were fairly tried, in the
wat-mest parts of England. Michaux strongly recommends its introduction
into the United states, observing that it could not fail to thrive wherever
