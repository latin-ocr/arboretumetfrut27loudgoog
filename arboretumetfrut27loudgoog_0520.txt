ΜΓ. South, in the Rath Society Paper-s, tells us that in the New Forest there
was an oak, which was fened in 1768, called the Langley Oak, the trunk of
which, aster it was cut down and barked, measured 36 ft. in circumfer-enee at the
base, and 18 st. in circumference at the height of 20 st.,which was the length of
the bole. The head was all knees and crooks, and the branches extendet!
about 4-0 ft. from the tree on ever side. The timber was perfectly sound, and
the tree was in a growing state w en it was cut down. .

fferybrdshire. The Great Oak, at Panshanger (fig. 1596.), growing on the
estate of Earl Cowper, is, as Strutt observeS, a fine s ecimen of the oak tree

though it has been called the Great Oak for more
than a century, it yet appears ‘⁸ even now to have
scarcel reached its meridtan ε the waving lightness of ,
its fea ery branches, dipping down to the very ground,
the straightness of its stem, and the redundancy of its
foliage, give it a character the opposite of antiquity,
and fit it sor the sequestered and cultivated pleasure- a
