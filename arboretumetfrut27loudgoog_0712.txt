white when fully exposed to the air. The leaves are shining, thin, changing
to a brown or russet colour in autumng and, on soil somewhat moist, or in
wet autumna, remaining on the tree throughout the winter. On young πως,
8υά on trees planted m hedgerows and pruned, the leaves are more certain
of re ' ' on during the winter, than on large, old, and denched trees.
The head οἳ the beech is, in ersi, so dense, that plants do not readily gmw

decay aster they fall. The branches of the beech, whether ιιι old or oung
trees, generally take an upright din-oetion, and form acute angles wi the
stem3 though, in old trees, the lower branehes are often horizontal, and some-
times beot down in the middle, 8υά curving upwards at the extreinity. The
branches are very numerous, 8υά the smaller shoots much divided; but the
direction both of the branches and spray is alwa s more or less ‘ t, 88
compared with that of the branehes and spra ofy the oak, the ash, an some
other trees. The roots do not descend daep‘ry into the soil, but extend to a
considerable distance close under the sut-iace. The rootlets 8υά libres are
not nearly so niimerous as in the ash and the elm. The barren flowers are
in round, stalked, droo ing heads, or catkins, of a light brown colour,
and 3 οι· 4· in each head). The fertile ones areplaced above them on the
branch, and are solitary, and on stouter stallis than the malo catkms. The
calyx of the fruit is 4-clest, clothed with simple pliant prickles. The
stigmas are 3 in each flower3 spreadin , acute, and down . Num-2, with 3

The seedlings of this tree, Sir J. E. Smith observes, when newly sprung up,
