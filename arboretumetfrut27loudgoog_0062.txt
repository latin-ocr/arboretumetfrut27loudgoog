Dr. Sims has noted, incidentally, in the Boe. Mag„ t. 1470„ that there
are two different specimens of the L. aestivalis in the Banksian herbarium;
that one of them, the flowering specimen from Jacquin’s herbarium, is
evidently 8 specimen of the L. geniculata Boe. Mag„ t· 1471.; and that the
other, in the leaves, is similar to the L. Diospsrms Boc. Mag„ t. 1470.
Fan-ther, Dr. Simo has noted, t. 1471.. that it is not easy to say to which
species L. aestivalis really belongs, and that if Linnaeus had meant the cha-
racter of supra-axillary branches to describe that the buds are roduced
below the branches, and not in the axils of them, it is as applicab e to the
allied L. Diosp rus and L. geniculata. (Boc. Mag„ t. 1470.) A shrub,
about δή. or 8 ‚high‚ a native of Virginia, in the swamps which inter-
sect the pine barrens. -1ntroduced in 1775. There was a plant in the
Horticultural Society’s (iarden, some years ago, which is since dead.
