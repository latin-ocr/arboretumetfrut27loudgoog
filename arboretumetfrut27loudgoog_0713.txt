was this tree that gave the first idea of grafting. A curious example wffl be

Geography. The common beech is a native of the temperate parts of
Europe, from the south of Norway to the Mediterranean Sea, and from
England to Constantinopie. It is also found in Palestine‚ Asia Minor,
Armenia, and Mazanderan. In Norway, it is found as far north as 590, in
favourable situations; and, in Sweden, to 580. According to Pallae, it is
plentifui in the southern provinces os Russia‚ and in Caucasum but it is not
common in the plains; and it is nowhere to be found in the northern pro-
vinces, It abounds in the foreste of Poland‚ and in Lithuania. The line of
beeches on the Alps rises to the elevation of 5132 ft„ between lat. 452⁰ and
46303 the snow lme being 3848 ft. higher. (Von But-h, as quoted by H. C.
Wateon.) In Switzerland, the beech occupies the south sides of the moun·
teins, where it rises as h· h as the Vaccinium Vitis idaea, and where the silver
fir clothes the north si e. §Nan Hist. Jordt„ voi. i. p. 9.) In Franoe, it is
found on the sloping sides o mountains, and on calcareous hins3 but almost
always on the south side. According to some, the European beech is also a
native of America, where it is known under the name of the white beech3 but,
as we are inclined to doubt whether this may not be something different from
the European beech, we have treated it as a variety, and given its geography,
when speaking of it, as such. (See p. 1953.) In Great Britain, the beech is
found in forestS, supposed to be indigenous, m various parts of the central dis-
