anal majesty, usually 'ven to the oak tree; it once formed part of the ancient
for est of Bern Womf,¹ which was a favourite hunting ground of Edward the
Confessor. ‘⁸ Tlns forest was at that time infested by a wild boat, which was
at last sla-in by a huntsman named Nigel, whom the king rewarded for this
senice by the grant of some lands, to be held by a horn; a mode of liver
common in those da .'’ (Lauder’e Gilpia, vol. is. p. 69.) This horn is sti 1
in the possession of e Aubre family, to whom it has descended by the female
line from that of Nigel. ‘⁴ he Chenies Oakss’ Professor Burnet (Eidoden-
dron, pl. 2. ,tells us, “is an old tree, which was go’ueig to decay in the reign
of Queen hzabeth3 but, a farm-yard being estabhsh in its vicinity, it has
revived, from the manure having sunk down to its rootS, and has now several
healthy and flourishing branches. Tradition traces it beyond the Norman
Conquest.” Amoen. Quen, fol. 2.)

Cheshire. he St. James'e Chronicle, No. 5038„ states that an oak was felled,
a few days before, at Morley in Cheshire, which produced upwards of 1000 st.
of measurable timber. It girted 42 st„ and one branch contained 200 st. of solid
timber. Its existence could be traced back for 800 years ς and it was supposed
to be one of the lar t trees in England. As a proof of this, it may be added,
that the hollow trun had, for some years before lt was cut down, been used for
housing eattle. Itis said that Edward the Black Prince once dined beneath
its shade. (Mart. Mill„ att. Ques-cm.) The Forest of Delamere, in this county,
contains man fine oaks. In this forest “ Edelfleda, a Mercian prineess‚
founded 8 lit e town for her retirement, which obtained the title of the
Happy City. The site is still known by the name of the Chamber of the
Forest.” (Gilpin.) The Combermere Oaks, at Combermere Abbey‚ near Nant-
wich, are ver fine old trees. One of these (Q. pedunculata) is 71 ἢ. high,
and the ιηιιιὲ “ 37 st. at Βῆ. from the ground; and another (Q. sessili-
flora) is 65 st. igh, and has a trunk 28ft. in circumference at 3 st. from the
ground. The latter is quite hollow; and the inside, which is fitted u as 8
room, will hold twelve people. Both these trees were described as ol trees
when the abbey and demesne were granted to an ancestor of the present Lord
Combermere, Sir G. Cotton, who was steward of the household to Η
V111.,in 1633. There is another old tree on an island in the lake, whi
is still in a growing state, and which is 80st. high, girting 24- ft.; and the dia·
meter of the head 1s 75 ft.

it, at Crockern Tor, was the seat of the Parliament of the Stanneries. The
forest has now nearly disappeared, but the moor stin extends about 20 miles
by ll miles, and ‘wolves were found on it as late as the reign of Queen Elin-
