Description, ᾂ-ο. The Constantinople nut forme
a handsome somewhat pyramidal trec, 50 ft. or
60 ft. δ’ h; with a whitisn burk, which peels off in
stripe. ¹ssl’he branches spread out horizontem-3 the
leaves are more an lar, and soster, than those of the
*common hazeh an the stipules are linear. The nuts
are small, round, and almost covered with the cab-m}
which ie double, and d ly laciniated, or fringed, with
the points reem-ved. T e tree grows rapidly, and with
great vigour, in the climate of London. It was at first

covered to be a lostytree. It is a native of Asia
Minor and Turkey3 but it bears the climate of both
Paris and London without the slightest injury.
Doefontaines tells us that Clusius first cultivated the
corylus Colfirna;·and that it was sent to him from ‘ff
Constantinople in 1582 (Hinc. des Arbres, ii. . 540.); and Prof. Martyn tells
us it was reintroduced four years afterwar ε by “ David Ungnad Baron in
Zorneck.‘' It ap to have been
first cultivated in ngland by Rea, a
floriet, who, in hie Flora, ublished in
1665, says that he had en “ many
goodly plante of the filbeard of Con-
stantinople.” ( p. 224.) It is also
mentioned by Ray, the celebrated bo-
tanical author, in his Historia Planta·
rum, published in 1686, among ‘⁴ the
rare trees and shrubs ‘² which he saw ⁴
a short time previously in the Palace
Gardens at Fulham. (See p. 41.)
Notwithstanding its beauty‚ and the
ease with which it is cultivated, the
Constantinople nut has never been
much in demand in English gai-dene.
It will grow in almost any soil, but does best in one similar to that adapted
for the common hazel. 1t is easily propagated by seed, grasts, or layers.
:Grasting on the common hezel ia, however, the most neral way, as the
nut osten proves abortive, both in French and English gar ena. The largest
trec in the neighbourhood of London is that at Syon, of which a portrait is
given in our last Volume. There are also lar trees at Ham House, Purser’s
Crosa, and in the grounds of Farnham Cas e, which bear fruit most yearS.
