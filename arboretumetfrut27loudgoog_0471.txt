Dercr’qition, ᾇο. According to Pursh, this is an el ant and large tree, the
most interesting of its genus, on account of the excel enee of its wood. In
favourable situations, it sometimes exceeds 70 st. in height, with a trunk 2 st.
or sft. in diameter. The
outer bark, on old trees, de-
taches itself transversely at
intervals, in hard platea, 6 in.
or 8 in. broad3 but, on trees .
with trunks not more than „325⁸

to renew its leaves. These,

afterwards disappears’. They
are about 2in. long, ser-
rated, somewhat cordiform
at the base, acuminate at the summit, of a pale tint, and fine texture. In
general appearance, they are not unlike those of the cherry tree. The

oung shoots are br0wn, smooth, and dotted with white, as are also the
feaves. When bruised, the leaves diffiise a very sweet odoni-3 and. as they
retain this progeny when dry if carefully preserved, they make an agree-
able tea, with e addition of sugat and milk. The male catkins are flexible,
and about 4in. long: the female ones are 10 or 12 lines long, and 5 or 6
lines in diameter; straight, cylindrical, and nearly sessile, at the season of their
maturity, which is about the lst of November. The tree is of very rapid
growth3 as a proof of which, Michaux gives an instance of one, which, in 19

is abundant in the neighbourhood of New York‚ and in Pennsylvania and
Maryland. Farther south, it is confined to the summit of the All hanies;
and 1t is found throughout their whole range, to its termination in eorgia.
On the steep and shady banks of the rivers which issue from these mountains,
in deep, loose, and cool suile, it attains its largest size. The wood of B. lenta,
when freshly cut, is of a rosy hue, which dee ns by exposure to the light.
