the former, 18225 in the latter, 1823. Mr. Borrer states that the insertion of
this kind in Hoolc. Br. Fl„ ed. 3., as a native of Britain, arose from a mistake
of his. (See Borrer in Comp. to Bot. Mag„ p. 225.) It forms a handsome·

8ηά the serratures of the ounger leaves fumished with glands. Neai-ly
allied to S. lucida, which, owever, has smaller leaves, and longer, more
slender, cathina. It flowers in April. S. Meyen'a‘na is 8 desii-able kind
of willow for introducing into ornamental plantatione of the coarser kind,
as it grows quickly, and has lar shining leaves, 8ηά the catkins of
flowers of the male are ornamen . It assimilates to S. pentandra in its
flowers, but is obviously distinct from that kind when the two are seen
growing near together. It is of freer growth, is more robust, and its leaves
are longer, narrower‚ 8ηά more shining. Mr. Borrer has communicated
the following remarks relative to the figure of S. Meyer-idua, given in Sal.
Wob„ No. 33.:—“ 1 never saw the catkins sessile, as represented in Sal.

‘ffiasfifffl aszffffizsskffiffiffiissffissagsossmtffissaffixae dsffifflss
ma be of the same species as S. Meyeridna3 and, if so, S. lucida is the
ol er name.” There are lanes at Woburn Abbey‚ at Henfield, and at Flit-
wick House, the latter of which are 13 ft. high. ·
