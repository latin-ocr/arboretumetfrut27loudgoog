Spec. Char„ ᾅσ. Leaves orbiculat, crenatc, reticulated with veins beneath.
(E . 1³1„ iv. p. 154.) A bushy shrub, seldom exceeding eft. or 3ft. in
height& with numerous branches, sl' htl downy when (young, and beset with
numerous, little, round, firin, smoot , s arply crenate
leaves, beautifully reticulated with veins, especially
beneath; and fiirnished with short footstalks, having
a pair of brown lanceolate stipules at their base. Cat-
kins erect, stalked, cylindrical, obtuse; the barren·ones
latei-al, and the fertile ones terminal. Scales of the s
latter 3-lobed, 3-flowered‚ permanent. Stigmas red. , · .
(Smith's Eng. FL, vol. iv. p. 155.) A native of Lap- . ·
land, Sweden, Bassia, and Scotland, in Europe3 and of
Hudson’s Bay, and other parts of Canada, in America3
on mountains, but almost always iu boggy places. Ac-
cording to Pallae, it is common iu the whole of the
north of Russia 8ηά Siberia; but not on the moun-
tains of Altai or Caucasus. In wet situations, he says,
the shoots grow to the length of 6 ῆ.; 8ηά, in a state of
cultivation, they grow as high as 9 ft.,and assume an erect form. This shrub
is of singular use in the domestic econom of the inhabitants of Lapland.
Its branches furnish them with their be s, and their chief fuel; its leaves,
with a better yellow dye than that obtained from the common birch ς its
seeds afford nourishment to the ptarmigan, or white artridge (Teu-ao
Lagopus L.), which supplies a considerable portion of t eir food, and also
forms anim ortant article of commerce 3 and, sor their medicine, it produces
the fungus olyporus fomentarius Mne-h„ respectin which some details will
be found under the head of Quercus, sect. Robur, om which the moxa, or
amadou, is repared, and which the Laplanders consider an efficacious
remedy in aff painful diseases. Such is the wonderful power of adaptation
of man, in a country possessin few natural resourccs. B. naua has been
in cultivation in Britam since e days of Miller, and is by no means un·
fregbuent in collections. Piice of plauts, in the London nurseries, is 22.
