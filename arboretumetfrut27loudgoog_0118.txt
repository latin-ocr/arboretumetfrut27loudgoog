are the worst of all the kinds of mulberry leaves ἔνι· feeding silkworms. The
fruit is of a deep red colour, an oblong form, and an agreeable, acidulous,
sugary taste. The trunk of the red mulberry is covered with a greenish
bark, more furrowed than that of the oaks and hickories. The perfect wood
(which is fine-grained and compact, though light,) is of a yellowish hue,

b many persons, it is esteemed equal.” (Illic-lu.) It, however, grows more
sffiwly, and requires a richer soil, it being generally found in valleys, at
a distance from the sea. It is a common opinion among shipwrights and
carpentem, that the wood of the male mulberry is more durable, and of a
better uality‚ than that of the female3 but Michaux does not appear to
credit t ‘ supposition ; which, indeed, evidently cannot be depended on, as
the male and female flowers are very often found on the same tree. The red
mulberry is well deserving of cultivation as an ornamental tree‚ from its
thick and shady foliage3 and as a fruit tree‚ from the agreeahle flavour of its
fruit. Miller mentions a plant of this species in the den of Fulham
Palace, which, in 1731. had been there for several years wit out producing ang
fruit: but which, at some seasons, produced a great number of catkins, muc
like those of the hazel nut; which occasioned Ray to give it the name
of corylus. (Dict., ed. l.) On enquiring for this tree in 1834, we found
nothing known about it. 1t is generally said that no insect feeds on the mul-
berry but the silkworm. In Smith and Abbott’s work on the insects of
Georgia, however, a specimen is given of the red mulberry, with the small

emliine :ngghfPhalaeffia punctatissima) feeding on it. ·( See Ima-ts qs Georgia,
