“ The form of the leaves in the same s ecies, and even in the same plant, can
never be depended upon. In S. ph licissslia, S. m rtillo'ides, S. arbfiscula, aud
S. repens, they vary from narrow- ceolate an being, attenuated towards
the base, in the three last-named species, to roundish·ovate and being cordate-
emarginate at the base. In some species, the form of the leaves is almost
always the same, as in S. viminalis, S. incana, and S. hippophaefolia. In
other speeies, the leaves vary 3 being serrated or entire, een or hoary on the
under surface, and glabrous or bairy, on the same plant. e same variation is
common on the exteriores the ovas-ies 3 which,.in S. ph licifolia, are some-

but never in form ς hence they afford the very best characteristics for distin-

“The variation of the different parts is not the onl difficulty with which the
