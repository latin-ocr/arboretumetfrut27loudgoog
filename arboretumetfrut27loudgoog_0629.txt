says Michaux, ‘⁶ this species is thinly disseminated in the foreste, and has
hitherto been considered as a variety of the white oak. In Maryland, and
a great part of Virgin‘n, where it abounds, it is called the box white oak, and
sometimes the iron oak, and the post oak. The last denomination only is

. used in the Carolinas, Georgia, and East Tenuessee.” The steep banks of
the Hndsoq, near New York, form its most northern boundar 3 and even
here, Michaux observes, it is only preserved by the influence o the sea air,
which somewhat moderates the severity of the winters. It thrives but in a
dry, sandy, or gravelly soil, not far from the sen3 but it attains its largoet size
near Baltimore. The farthest int at which it was found to the west, was
about 150 miles ‚from Philadei'ohia, on the road to Pittsburg. It is most
abundant in Virginin and Maryssnd, between the Alleghanies and the 888.
“ Growing in a less humid soll, its timber is less elasuc, but finer grained,
stro , and more durable‚ than that of the white onk: hence it is pre-
serr ‚ in Americs, for posts, and is used with advantage by wheelwrights
and coopers.” Maeli-r.) In ship-building‚ it 18 employed principall for the

Baltimore and Norfolk is due, in a t measure, to their ' g made, in
