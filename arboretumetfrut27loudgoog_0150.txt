St. Jamee'a Park next to the palace are some of them about 160 years of age.
One, which stood at the upper end, turning to the Green Park, being hlown
down, was found to be above 60 st. in height, and near 12 ft. in circumference
near the root. They are now (in 1805) considerabl more thau 200 years
