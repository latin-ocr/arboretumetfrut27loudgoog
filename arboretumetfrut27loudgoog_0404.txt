Description. A rapid owing tree, rather exceeding the middle size, with
a straight clean trunk, l in proportion to its thickness3 and a smooth bark,
which becomes grey, 8ηά cracks with age. The branches, which extend
horizontally, and are not very numerous, become 1509
pendulous as the tree advances in age. The ‘
