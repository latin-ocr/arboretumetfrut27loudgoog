of M. Hertig, there are only the sycamore, the Scotch pine, and the aab, which
produce more heat and light in burning than the beech. Itis superior to the
oak in this respect, in the proportion of 1540 to 14973 and its chareoalis
superior to that of the oak, as 1600 is to 1459. Charcoal is made in great
quantities from the beech, in Buckinghamshire, for the manufacture of gun·
wder. The beech, burnt green, produces hest and light relatively to the
h burnt d ,as 1181 is to 1540. These experimenta of M. Hartig are,
however, consi cred by some as not uite correct. The ashes of the beedu
are said 1) Bosc to be rich in tas ς but this is doubted by Bandrillart.
Werneck ound experimentell , at, out of 73 species of trees, there were 4⁷,
the ashes of the wood of whic yielded more potash than the ashes of that of
the beech. He found that 10011). of beech wood, burnt green, gave l lb.4 oz.
‘1 grains of this salt: but that 100 11). of the harh and spray gave l lb. 1002.
The bark, both in America 3¹¹¹d in Britain, is used for tanning, though it is con·
sidered of no great value for that purpose. Monteath ranks it in the fisth place,
along with that of the birch ς 1)οι1ι of which, he says, are considerably weaker
than that of the Spanishchestnut, and not nearly equal to that of the oak.
Evelyn says, “ of old, they made their vasa vindemiatoris and corbes messoriae,

“ and vessessoto preserve wine in3 and that curiously wrought cup, which the
shepherd, in the Bumlicks, wagern withall was en ven by Alcimedon upon
the bark of the beech.'’ (Hunt. Evel„ i. p. 135.) Ἧι) leaves, gathered green,
and dried‚ were formeri used in Britain, and still are in various parts of the

of what Evelyn sa s here, as to the excellence of beech leaves for matti-esses.
We used always tot ink that the most luxurious and refreshingbffl wasthatwhieh
vails universally in Ital , and which consists osan absolute pile of πῃπῇ-ω
gffed with the elastic spat e of the Indian σοι-ης which beds have the advantage
of being sost, as well as elastic; and we have always found the sleep enjoyed on
them to be peculiarly sound and restorative. But the beds made of beech
leaves are really no whit behind them in these qualities, whilst the fragrant
smell os green tea, which the leaves retain, is most gratifying. The objection
to them ιε the slight crackling noise which the leaves occasion, as the indivi-
dual turns in bed. but this is no inconvenience at all, or, if so in any degree,
ιι ιε an inconvenience which is much overbalanced by the advantages of this
most luxuriant couch.” (Laud. Gilqu„ i. p. 103.) As beech leaves are very
long in decaying, they are valuable in gardening, for protecti herbaceous
plljantgs from frost, or mulching round the stems of half y trees and

Tloe Fruit, the nut of which is called beech mast in En land, and la aina-in
France, has a taste semei-dist approaching to that of the {azel nut. t forms
an excellent food for swine ς but the flesh of those that have been fattened on
it does not keep so well as that of swine which have been fed on acorns. The
fat, also, is more oily, and, when boiled, is apt to waste in the pot. Beech mast
is much sought aster by wild animals, particularly by badgers, which it fattens
