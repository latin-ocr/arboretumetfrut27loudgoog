following remarks on it z—“ This species is

quite distinct from the Q. Flex, its nearest con-

gener. The leaves are thicker‚ more rounded at

the point, of a dull glaucous green, and the tree

al ther is of a more compact and less grace-

ful orm than the Italian ilex. The and essentia! difference, however,

consiste in the acorna, which are edib e, and, when in perfection,are as good

as, or superior to, a choetnut. To give this sweetness, they must be kept3

as, at first, they have a considerable taste of the tanniu, hke those of the

other species, which disappears in a few days, and accounts

for the scepticism of some writers, who assert that both

sweet and bitter are the produce of the same tree, and that

their sweetness is no character. These are the edible acorns

of the ancients, which they believed fattened the tunny fish

on their passage from the Ocean to the Mediterranean3 a

fable only proving that the acorna grew on the delicious ἵ

shores and rocks of Andalusia‚ which, unhappil , is no lon ᾗ

the case. Remains of them may, however, s ⁰ be trac in

the west3 and they fattened the swine which produced the ,

celebrated salted meats of Malaga and that vicinit . These

are the bellotae, which Teresa, the wife of Sanc o Panza,

conati-ies, with a sort of apology for their small intrinsic value, from their

size and flavour. This species ιε, beyond question, very hard ; 1 believe

even more so thau the ilex os Italy. It ascends the mdes o the sierras

in the inclement region os the centre of Castile3 and, in Arragon, is seen

within the limits os the Pinus sylvestris and P. uncinata3 as also in the

cold and wintry valley of Andorre. The widest foreste of it are now in

Estremadura, where the best sansages, and other salted meatu, are made

from the vast herds of swine which are bred in them. This species ought

to be denominated Q. hispanica, instead of a weak and οὔπω-8 name from

a wood (which, 1 have heard, no longer exiam), where the trec may possibly

not have been a native, although the climate and soil of Lower Languedoc

the reason why the kings os 8 ain had succeeded in getting it to grow in
