Desa-iption, ᾆσ. The shingle onk is from 40 st. to bost. high, with a &mk
from ist. to lst. 3 ἰιι. in dimneter. Its trunk, even when‘old‚ is covered with
“ a smooth bnrkg and, for three Sourths of its height, it is leden with branchee.
It hes nn uncouth form when bere in winter,
but is beautiful in summer, when elad in ite
thick tusted foliage. The leaves are long, lan·
ceolate, entire, and of n nhining green.” (N.

Amer. Syl„ i. fl. 70.) Michnux adds that the
trunk is branc ing, and ‘often crooked3 and ¹
the wood, though hard and heevy, has open
poreglike that of Q. rnbra. Euat of the Alle-
ghnniee, th'n species in rnreg but west ofthe
mountains it ιε more multiplied, and better
known. Its most northern boundnry ie the
neighbourhood of philadelphia ς hot it is found ἱ
in the greatest abundnnce in Kentuck and
Tenneeeee3 alno in the country os the ⁰ oin,
where it is called by the French chene ἃ latter,
or the rath oak. ‘⁴ In the western parte of
Pennsylvania and Virginis, small lawnz, covered
only with tau grass, are frequently seen in the
foreste, around which this oali forms entire

ves: insulatedtreee are aleofound in cool
{zaid situations. It ie, probably, from its
flourishi in open exposui-es, that it is most abundant in the munti-y of the
Illinois, w 'ch consiste of immensurable samnnahs, stretching in every directioni,
to which the forestu beer no eeneible roportion.'’ (Midan) This tree wan
brought to Englnnd in 1786, by Mr. ohn Frater, but is rnre in collectione.
According to the youutffi· Miehnux, it has no merit but in its foliage, the wood
being even inferior to t of the willow oali, which it eatly resemble& and
ιο crooked, aa to be fit onl for fuel. The elder chaux, however, says
that, in the country of the ⁶ ois,itis used sor ehinglee. There ia atree
of thia species in the Horticultural Society’s Garden.
