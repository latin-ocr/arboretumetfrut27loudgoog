the birch, we cannot place it in the first rank of forest trees; and the onk,
the beech, and other trees of stately growth, are to be preferred to it in good

The wood of 0 (1 birch trees is harder than that of young trees, and it also
weighs considerably more ε for it appears, by the experimenta of Hartig, that
the wood of a tree of 60 years’ growth, weighed, dry, 3610. 13 oz.; while
that of a tree of 25 years’ growth, in the same state of dryness, only
weighed 35lb. 502. ‘The wood soon rots when laid on the ground in heaps3
and, therefore, immediately after the trees are felled, they ought to be drawn
out of the wood, and taken into the timber-yard, where they ean be exposed
freely to the air. As fuel, birch wood occupies the leth place amon 21
different sorts3 and is to the fuel of the beechas 13 isto 15: but, ‘ the

corrupted for ages, even in situations exposed alternately to air and water, cold
and moisture. Pallas refers, in proof of this, to the tombs near Jenisca, in
Siberia3 and to the vaults under the Kremlin, in Moscow. When Mauper-
