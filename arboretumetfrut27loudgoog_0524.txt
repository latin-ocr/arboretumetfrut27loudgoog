been in the habit of cutting out and carrying away small blocks or slices of the
sounder part of the wood as relies, or to manufactus-e into snuffboxes3 to prevent
these depredatione, Lord Northampton caused the following notice to be painted
on a board, and nailed to the tree:—‘ Out of respect to the memory of
