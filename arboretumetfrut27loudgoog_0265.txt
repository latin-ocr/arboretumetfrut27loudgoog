name of S. Meyeffina ς which species, he says, is readily distinguished from
S. lucida by ita much latger leaves, and shorter obtuse catkins. There are

Mr. Ver-non, a merchant at Aleppo, who sent it to his seat at Twiekenham
Park, at about 1730, where it was soen growing by the celebrated Peter
Collinson, in 1748. In the Hortus Kewemir, the date of its introduction is
given as 16923 but no particulata are stated respecting it. Delille, in
a note to his L’Homme des &amp-5, says that Tournefort first introduced
it into Europe3 and some authors, on the authority of the St. James'ae
C'hrom'cle sor August, 1801, assert that Pope introduced it into England,

published about the time that Pope’s willow was cut down, because the
possessor of his villa was annoyed by persons asking to see it. · The mo‘st
