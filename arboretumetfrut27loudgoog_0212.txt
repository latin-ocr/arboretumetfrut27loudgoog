either from the same buds as the leaves, or, more commoni , from different
ones. Their florets are almost invariably separated, being a l barren on one
plant, and fertile on another of the same species. The growth of the dwarfest
species, such as S. herbhcea, is sloW‚ and, in its native habitat, not above
1 in. a year, and often not so much; that of the larger shrubs, in their native
habitate, varies from 5 in. or 6 in. to aa man feet, “peciaffl when the plante

tree kinds, more especially of S. alba and S. Russellidna, is equally rapid
when young3 so that in ten years, in the climate oi' London, in suitable soil,
and within reach of water, these kinds will attain the hei t of 50 st. or 60 ft.
The branches of most os the tree kinds have an upward irection, and have a
flame-like motion in the wind, as in S. alba3 but in others they are spreading,

is a relative subject. r. Borrer considers the instance observed iu S.
Crowedna a monstrosity. (Επεὶ. Boc. Snppl„ t. 2655.) He adds that the
stamens “ are represented as changi into ’' ovaries, ‘⁴ as those of S. bicolor
Ehrle„ and of some of the common offiium, have been observed to do.” It is
likely that Mt. Borrer would apply the same remark to every instance of the
filaments occul-ring in a state of combination. The following is a list of kinds
in which the filaments have been observed iu this state3 and the raetical cul-
tivator may instruct himself by investigating, relatively to the ve remark,
