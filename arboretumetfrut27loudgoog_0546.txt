Where the grain is twisted, no timber is so well adapted for posts, either ιιι

lasts longer w ere it is subject to be alternately wet and dry3 and oak piles
have been known to endure many centuries. Shingles, pales, and laths

oak of mountsinous districts is greatly preferred to the more rspid owing
and larger oak of the valleys. Oaks of from 15 to 30 years’ growt make
the most durable poles. The young tree, when from 5ft. to 10 st. high, makes
excellent hoops‚ which, Evelyn says, we ought to substitute for those ofhazel
and ash, as they are six times more durable: it also makes the ver best walk-
ingsticks, and very good handles to carters' whips. Of the roots, velyn sa ,
were formerly made bafts to daggers, handles to knives, tobacco·boxes, mat e-
matical instrumenta, tablets for artists to paint on instead of canvass, and elegant
camleted joiners’ work. Oak wood, every one knows, is referred before all
others for ship-building, in the tem erate regions of both emispheres. The
Q. pedunculata (the chene blanc o the French), from its toughness, does not
splmter when it is struck b a cannen ball, and the bole made b a hall is con-
sequently much easier to p ug u 3 but it is said, on the other and, that this

we conclude that Secondat has here mistaken ’the n’ame of the kind to,
which he has assigned these properties. The best oak for ship purposes,
according to Jaume St. Hilaire, is that which is grown in the south of
France; and the best ships in the world, he says, are built in Toulon, or in
Spain. The worst oak for ship-building‚ according to this author, is that sent
to Britain from Dantzic, and other ports of the Baltic. The bark of both

species is indiscriminately used for tanning, though that of Q. sessiliflora is
