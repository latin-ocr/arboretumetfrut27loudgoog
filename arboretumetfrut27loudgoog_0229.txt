riba, in common baskets of 8 roundish form, are two: a vertit-al rib, or hoop,
the upper part of which is destined to form the handle; and a horizontal
hoop, or rim, which is destined to support all the subordinate ribs, on
which thewands are vattled. The two main ribs are first bent to the re-
mired form, 8οά made fast at their extremities by nails or wire. They
are then joined together in their proper position, the one intersecting the
