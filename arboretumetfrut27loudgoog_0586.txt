under side of the excrescence. The larvae foun beneath the excrescenee
were destitute of legs, slightly hairy at the sides, and narrowed towards the
head ε they were depressed and fleshy, with two oints at the mouth and at
the extremity of the body ε they were evidently e larvae of some dipterous
insect; and it does not appear that they had any actual connexion with the
origin of the excreseence m question. At the same time, he opened some of the
same excrescences, which seemed younger, without puboecenee, and osa

several species of insects to the oak, which do not obtain subsistenee therefiom,
but take up their abode either from some partiality to the tree itself, or for
the urpose of feeding upon the different insecta which live on it. The

(Dic-t. d'Agrioult„ art. Chene), and the observation affords an example of
many admirable compensatione so common in the economy of the aniinal

the processionary caterpillars (which are extreme! destructive to the oak)
are also most abundant. (Marqm’s, Essat' sur les mordes ngbtales et Ani-
