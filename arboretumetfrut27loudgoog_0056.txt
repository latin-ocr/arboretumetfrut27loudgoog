Pallas mentions havin found it in Tauria. The exact date of its introduc-
tion into Britain is un nown, but it must have been previous to 1562, as it is
mentioned in Turner’s Her-bal, published in that year3 and we find that, in
the reign of Elizabeth, the floors of the houses os distinguished ersom were¹
strewed with bay leaves. It was formerly considered medicina , both leaves
and berries being highly aromatic and stomachic3 they are also astringent
and carminative. An infusion os them was not only considered beneficial,
when taken internally, but it was used for fomentatione, διο. At present, the
principal use of the tree is as an ornamental plant, though the leaves are still

from the embraces of Ap0110,and reaching the banks of her parent stream, called
on the river god for aid, and was changed into a laurel. In the age os
Roman greatness, this tree was considered as the emblem of victory, and also
of clemency. The victorious generals were crowned with it in their triumphal

- processions3 every common soldier carried a sprig of it in his hand; and

even the dispatches announcing a victory were wrapped up in, and ornamented
with, leaves of bay. The aromatic odour of these trees was sup ed by the
ancient Romans to have the power of dispelling contagion, and mag a pes-
tilence the Emperor Claudius removed his court to Laurentiae, so celebrated
for its bay trees. Theophrastus tells us that superstitious Greeks would
keep a bav leaf in their mouths all day, to resen-ve themselves from missor-
tunee. The Greeks hed eise divinem w 0 were eeued Daphnephegi, be-

was the favourite tree of the poets: and we are told that Maia, the mother of
Virgil, dreamt that she was delivered of a bay tree; and that one of these
trees sprang from Virgil’s ashes, and is still growing 'over his tomb. In later
times it was supposed tq be a safeguard αῗίῃ st lightning3 and Madame De
Genlis mentions the device of the Count e Dunois‚ which was a bay tree,
with the motto “ 1 defend the earth that bears me.” It was a custom in the
middle ages, to place wreaths of laurel, with the berries on, on the heads of
those poets who had particularly distinguished themselves ς hence our ex·
pressim, poet laureate. “ Students who have taken their degi-ees at the
universities are called bachelon, from the French bachelier, which is derived
from the Latin baccalaureus, a laurel berry. These studente were not allowed
to marry, loet the duties of husband and father should take them from their
literary pursuits; and, in time, all single men were called bachelors.” (S loa

onl raised from layers or cuttings. As an evergreen shrub, not only beau·
tiful in itsels, but connected with many classical and interesting associatione,
it ought to have a place m every collection. As it forms a dense conieal
bush, when not trained to a single stem, it is well adapted for garden hedges,
This tres is very tenacious os ife, and the root or stump of an apparently
dead tree will often send up suckers two years after it has appeared to
be dead.
