says that a large stool or stump of elder, split with 8 hatchet mto five or six
pieces, and planted, will form so many trees ς and, also, that if, instead of
splitting this stool‚ it be covered over 2in. or 3 in. deep with soil, it will, in
two or three years, throvv up shoots, which vin become rooted planta. We
have planted with success, he says, trees obtained in this way, of 7 st„ 8 ft„ and .
10 st. in height, without heading them down 3 but, in situations exposed to
the wind, they require to be cut down to within 5 in. or 6in. of the surface
· of the ground. Another mode of multiplying the elder is, to cut a young branch
hals through at the und, lay it down horizontally along the surface, and
cover it w1th 2in. o soil, when almost every bud will produce a shoot, and
every shoot vill form roots. We have already described this mode as em-
ployed for raising plum stocks. '5¹8oe p: 690.) Νοξπὶώεωιιάἰιιὶςὴωο different

For raising the elder from seoda, Sang directs the cathns to be gethered
in dry weather, as soon as the seeds are matured which is easily known by
the scales beginning to open), and carried to a lo where they should be
spread out thinly. “ They are afterwards to befrequently turned, and the seeds
will fall out in the act os turning, Tbey are much more ready to drop out,
if the 10st happen to be placed above an apartment where a good fire is kept.
When all the seeds which will readily come out by the above plan have

know the quality of elder seed‚” he observes, ‘⁴ it is better to sow pretty
thick, and to thin out the plante, if necessary, the followingh spring.” The
seeds are generally collected about the end os October, or e beginning of
November. Where the trees overhang water, it is recommended by the
Continental authors to eut off the extremities of the branches containing the
eatkins, and let them dro into the water, afterwards fiahing them out with

nete. The cones may be ept till spring, isin a perfectly dry situation, and
excluded from the air. The seeds may be proved before-sowing, by bruising
them on the thumb nail3 when, if they have an kernel, 1t mu show 8 white
farinaceous substance, and some pearance o oil or watery matter. AB
