go lar in the Horticultural Society’s Garden, which, in 1834, were 23 ft.
⁸ ‚ aster being ten years planted. The leaves are remarkable for their fine
rich yellowish red tinge, when they first appear in spring3 and for their
large aize, deep indentations, and fine glaucous green during summer: ou
which account, this poplar deserves a place in every collection as an or-
namental tree- We consider it as a variety of P. tremula, from which it
is not more distinct than P. alba aceriffilia is from P. alba, or Tssia
europaeh grandiffilia is from T. e. parvisolia. Plants, in the London

longer. The tissue of the bark of young trees is of a coarsish texture:
which, by rendering its component parts obvious, makes it an eligi-
