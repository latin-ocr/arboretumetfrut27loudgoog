Dee ” tion, Proper-ties, ἅτ. The stems of this species are roundish,
branchzg twisted, and climbing by elongation, among other shrubs, and in
hedges, to the height of ὁ st. or 8 ft. or upwards. When bruised, broken, or
rubbed, they yield a strong and peculial· odour, not unlike that which proceeds
from rats and mice. The roots smell like potatoes; and both roots and

· stalks, upon being chewed, first cause a sensation of bitterness, which is soon

followed by a considerable degree of sweetnesS, whence the specific name.
ΊῚιε plant has been in repnte for its medical virtues since the days of Theo-
hrastuS, by whom it was called Vitis sylvestris3 by Pliny, it was called
elon-tum. Gerar-d, Boerhaave, Cullen, and otherS, attribute to the berries,
and also to the leaves and stalks, many virtues3 and the plant is still in great
repnte among rustic practitioners. In Wales a salve is made from the leaves,
which is considered infallible in removing brnises. A decoction of the whole
plant, or an infusion of the young twigs, is considered excellent in rheumatic
cases, and also in jaundice and scm-vy. The berries are poisonous3 and, as
they are common in hedges, they are very frequently eaten by children,
on whom they operate by exciting violent vomiting and purging. To lessen
their deleterions effecta, warm water should be administered immediately, and
in large quantities, to dilute the poison, and provoke vomiting. To revent
