In England, e walnut 18 very seldom either budded or grafted3 and,
though Boutcher recommends inarching‚ we believe it has been ractised
only on a very limited scale. In Jersey, we are informed by Mr. ι annders,
nurseryman there, the walnut and the sweet chestnut are sometimes, but
very rarely, grafted5 and that, to insure success, the operation must be per-
formed while the stock is young, and the scion must be about the same size 88
