Some antiquarians, however, state that the tabulae rotundae were introduced
into this country by St hen, and believe that the table in question was
made by him, which in t at case would diminish its age 600 years; leaving
it, however, above seven centuries to boast οῖς eno h to render it a most
valuable and interesting monument. It has been pgiomted by many bullen,

and very ancient3 the old oaken ulpit, 8180, which now adorna the new
structure, was the donation of Sir Ju ius Coesar, Aa). 1621. The rich carvings
in oak which ornamented the King’s room in Stirling Castle were executed
about 300 years ago, 8ηά are many of them still in good praervation in the
collectione of the ctu-icus. In digging away the foundation of the old Savoy
Palace, London, which was built wards of 650 years since, the whole of
the piles, many of which were gip oak, were found in a state of perfect
soundness, as, 8180, was the planking which covered the pile heads. (stedgoki.)

finnous from its defence by Horatius Cocles, and which existed at Rome in
the reign of Ancus Martius, 500 years before Christ, might be given as
another example. The pilee which supported the butu-esses, and immense
uncouth starhngs which confined the waterway 8ηά 80 tly disfigured
old London Bridge, were some of them of oak3 8ηά 1 [ sessor Burnet}

still older piles on which the bridge piers restet} were 8180 in a very strong
and sound condition: nay, those stakes which it is said the ancient Britons
drove into the bed of the Thames to impede the progress of Julius Caesar,
near Oatlands, in Surrey, some of which have been removed for examination,
have withstood the destroyer time nearly 2000 years.” (Amoen. Quen, fol. 7.)
In Cambdcn’s time, the 18οε where these stakes were found was called
Gowey Stakes. In the emta Monumeuta, vol. ii. pl. 7„ is 8 sketch of
an old wooden church at Greenstead, near Ongar, the ancient Aungare, in
Eseex. The inhabitants have 8 tradition, that the corpse of a dead kingonce
rested in this church 3 and it is believed to have been built 88 8 temporary re-
ceptacle for the body of St. Edmund (who was slain A. n. 946), and subse-
quently converted into a parish church. The nave, or body, which rendere
it so remarkable, is composed of the trunks of oaks, about lft. 6in.in dia-
meter, split through the centre, and ronghly hewn at each end,to let them into
a sin at the bottom, and a lank at the top, where they are fastened by wooden
pegs. The north wall is ormed of these half οάε, 8οι side by side as closel
as their irregular edges will permit. In the south wall there is an interval!
for the entrance3 8ηά the ends, which formerly were similar, have now to the
one a brick chemel, and to the otherawooden belfry, attached. The original
building is 29 st. 9in. long, by 14 st. wide, and 5 st. 6in. high on the sides, which
supported the primitive roos. The oaks on the northern side have suffered
more from the weather than those on the southern side3 but both are still
