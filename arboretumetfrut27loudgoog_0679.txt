summits of ese mountains are covered with snow until May and June.
‘⁸ The snow not melting until the sun has reached its most northern limit,
the increase of temperature is great and sudden, and the vegetation ropor-
tionably rspid.” (p. 20.) ‘⁸ In ascending the Choor Mountain, on e 9th
of May, at first the ordinary Himalayan trees, such as Rhododendron arbo-
reum and Quercus lanata, were met with; the pines then made their appear-
ance. Every thing looked like the revival of spring: some of the trees and
shrubs were putting forth new leaves, and others were in full flower. Higher
up, ‚patches of snow were seen3 and be ond this every thiu had a wintry
aspect: the snow lay in masses, tho h etached, having m ted away from
round the trunks osmany trees and e blocks of ” s rock. At first, the
Coniferae and other trees were intermixed with o ες but, latterly, the osk
grew alone. Q. semicarpifolia formed the forest. On emerging from this, there
is only a short ascent to the peak.” (p. 21.) Q. lanata was introduced about
1818, and was first planted at Kew. There are now (91837) lhnts of it
lo st. high against the walls in the Horticultural Society s Gar en, and in
sront of one of the stoves at Kew, which roduce acorns. In the arboretam
of Messrs. Loddiges‚ and in that at twick, planta of this species have
stood out, without any protection, in the open garden for several years3
but they are annuslly killed down within a short distance of the ground.
There are small plsnts in pots, at Messrs. Loddiges's, which bear acorns.
