eatest velue, both as a tree and a shrub: in both characters, it forms very
ffindsome single obJects‚ or small groups; and, in both, it is a most desireble
underwood in plantatione of European oaks. It thrives better than most
other evergreen trees-'in the immediate vieinit of cities, even where eod
smoke abounds; and hence it is a most desirab e tree for public parks and

pots, one in a pot, as is generally practised in the London nurseries. So
reared, the plants might be sent to any distance without the slightest injury;
and, when they are turned out of the pot into the open ground, if the soil
and situation be suitahle‚ they will grow with amazin rapidity. In the year
