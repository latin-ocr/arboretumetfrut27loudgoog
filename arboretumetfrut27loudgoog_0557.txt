however, the oak, if planted in open situations, and if the stem be divested of
its side shoots only to a moderate height, will produce a sufficient number of
crooked arms and branches for ev p in naval architecture. It is
almost unnecessary to obaerve, that, w en e objectis shi ' ber, and timber

why plantations of 1t prove less profitable those o other trees. In
answer to this it may be stated, lst, that, as the oak is almost in every case
planted among nurse trees, which are not cut down tiu they are of some value
as poles or timber, there can hardly be said to be such a thing as a young oak

the timber of the oak, even when of small size, the value of the berk, and, as
Matthew observes, the slight comparative injur of its shade to coppice-wood,
hedge-plants, grass, corn, or other eroga, “ sho d give a preference to this tree
for planting, wherever the climate an soil are smtable, over every other kind,

to all other trees. It produces the most valuable timber and bark in that
situation, and does less injury to the hedge, and to the herbage or corn be-
neath it, than any other species, unless, perhaps, as Matthew observes, the
epple and the pear be exceptedg because the horizontal roots do not run
near the sur-face, and the buds come later into leaf than those of any other
British tree. The general form, and the great variety of outline, of the
oak, as well as its ‚colour, both in spring and autumn, also harmoniae in a
