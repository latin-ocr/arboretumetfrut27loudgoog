British catalogues.

Description, ὅτ. The red, or slip ery, elm, according to Michaux, bears a
strong resemblance to the Dutch e m. It forms a trec from 50ft. to 60 st.

districts of the Carolinas 8ηά Georgia, this species of elm is found in all
parts of the United States and of Canada.'’ (Mic-baux.) ‘⁴ It is less
abundant than the white American clm ; and the two species are rarely found
together, as the red elm requires a substantias soil, free from moisture, and
even delights in elevated and open situations, such as the banks of steep rivers,
particularly the Hudson and the Susquehanna. The beart-wood is coarser-
grained and-less compact thau that of U. americana, and is of a dull red tinge;
whence the name of red elm. Even in the branches of lin. or 2in. in diameter,
it consiste rincipally of perfect wood. It is the best wood in the United

The leaveS, and bark of the branches, macerated in water, yield 8 thick and
abundant mucila (whence the name of slippery eim), which is used as 8
refreshing drink or colds, and for emollient lasters, in the place of the marah

Α. S.) A tree, 30 ft. high. introduced in 1820.

’ Description, ᾅσ. The wahoo elm is a trec seldom exceeding 30 st. in height,
with a diameter os 9 in. or 10 in. The flowers do not differ materially from those
of the other elme. The seeds are fringed, 8ηά much smaller than those of the
white American elm. The leaves are oval, doubly denticulated, and rather small.
The most remarkable part of the tree is, however, a fungous appenda e, two
or three lines wide, attached to the branches throughout their whole cngthg
from which the name os alata (winged) has been given to the species. The
