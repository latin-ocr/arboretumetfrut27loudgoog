take. Indeed, the tree of this species in Loddiges’s arboretam was upwards
of 15 st. high in 1834. Q. lyrata is a native of the southern states of
North America3 where, according to the younger Michaux, “ it is never seen
in the long narrow marshes which intersect the pine barrem, bnt is found
exclusively in the great swamps on the borders of the rivers, which are often
ovsrflowed at the ris‘ of the waters, and are inaccessible during three
quarters of the year.” mfft is not mentioned by Catesby‚ and afipears to have
been first described by ⁴Walther,in his Flora Carolbiiana. It was introduced
into England in 1786, but is seldom met with in collections. The wood,
though inferior to that of the white and post oak8, is more compact than
would be.supposed from the swamp nature of its native habitat ι it will,
however, grow on dr soil ς and the e der Michaux states that, even in loose
sandy soil, it grew aster than any other oak in his nurseries. (Hie. dee

varieties a low shrub. In the climate of London the trees grow freely,
and promise to attain a considerable size. In general form, they are as
handsome as any of the American oaks; but their foliage dies off with very
little colour, what there is being generally of a whitish or brownish yellow.

Varieties. These are by some authors treated as species ς but they are so
obviously alike in their leaves and bark from their infancy upwards, that
there does not remain a single doubt in our minds of their being only
varieties. However, for the sake of those who think otherwise, and also to
mark the peculiarities of each variety, we shall give the identifications,
