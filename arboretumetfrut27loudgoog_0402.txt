abundance of fibrous roots the first season, ought to be transplanted into nur-
sery lines sor at least one year before removal to their final situation. The
trec is admirably adapted for thiokening or filling. up blanks in woods and
plantation53 and, for this pu e, truncheons may⁴be planted 3 in. or 4in. ia
diameter, and lost. or 12 ἢᾞιοιὲὴ. These truncheons have the great advan-
tage os not being evershadowed by the adjoining treeS, which is almost always
the case when young planta are used for filling up vacancies among old toees.
The truncheons need -not be inserted ver deeply m the soil, because the roots
which they protrude, like those of all o er trees having creeping rootS, ori·
ginate in a pert of the ‘trutik near the surface. When the white poplar is
planted in messes, with a view to produce timber, the plante ought to be from
15st. to left. apart every way, and they ,may be most profitably cut down
at the end of 30 or 40 years3 but, when they are only to produce poles of

a branch is broken off by accident, or a stump suffered to deeay, the water
seldom fails to be conducted to the heart of the trunk, and, b bringing on
eariee, to rot the timber. The leaves, and also the trunk, 0 the tree are
liable to be infested by fun ⁶ of which several species are common ,to the
different species of poplar. &ee p. 1638.) The porosit of the trunk, stool,
and roots is favourable to the production of fungi of t e lerger kinds; and
the Polyporus igniarius ms ma frequently be seen on the trunk of the
trec, or on the stool ofa tree that as been cut down, of gigantic size.
