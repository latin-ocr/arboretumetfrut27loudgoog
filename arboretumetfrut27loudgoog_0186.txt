Grenoble, “ of all others the most beautiful and esteemedl’ To render the
wood better coloured, Evelyn continues, “joiners put the boards into an
oven after the batch is forth, or lay them in a warm stableg and, when the
work it, polish it over with its own oil, very hot, which makes it look blac
and sleek3 and the older -it is, the more estimabkz but then it should not be
put in work till thoroughly sessoned3 because it will shrink beyond expect-
ation. It is only not good to confide in it much for beams or joina, because
of its brittleness3 of which, however, it has been observed to give timely
notice, like that of the chestnut‚ before it breaks.” (Haut. Evel„ p. 172.) For
fuel, according to Bandrillarn the wood, when dry, is of nearly the same vulne
as that of the common sycamore‚ burnio with a mild flame5 but, as ohan-eod,
it is not productive. In Britain, the c ief uses of the timber are for gun-
stocks (it bei found lighter in proportion to its strength and elasticity than
any other), a for musical instrumenta, turne , and toy-making.

The most valuable part of the walnut is its gun, which is much in demand,
throughout Europe and other parts of the world, for the table, and for various
other purposes. In a youn and green state, it is pickled and preserved ς and,
when mature, it is used as §ond for the poorer classes in the countries where it
abounds, and at the dessert of the richer classes. In the north of Italy, in Swit-
zei-land, and in the south of France, the roads are lined for many miles together
with walnut trecs; and, during August and September, when the fruit is ripe,
or nearly so, and the weather so warm that the shelter of a house is not
required to rotect the traveller from cold‚ he may welk under the sliade of
the tree‚ an eat its fruit during the day, and sleep under it during night. We
have even known the case of a person who travelled by a public conveyance
from Florence to Geneva, eating scarcely an thing by the way but walnuts
and heads of maize, which he thered by the road side. About the end ol*
June, walnuts are preserved, eit er with or without their hnsks= in the latter
snite they are most agreeable, but in the former most strengthening to the
stomach. Gerard sayS, “ The green and tendet· nuts, boyled in sugat, and eaten
as suckarde, are a most pleasant and delectable mente, comfort the stoniache,
and expell poyson.” Δ fine stomachic liquent is made from the young nuts
about the middle of June3 and about this time, also, they are pickled. In
August, before the shells become hard, they are eaten in what the Freneh
call en eamean-r, that is, with the kei-nel, while green, scooped out with a short,
broad, brass knife, and sessoned with vinegar, salt, pepper, and shallots. The
nuta, for this pu ose, should be taken at least a fortnight before they are ripe3
they should be rown into water as soon as they are separated from the
liusk, and allowed to remain there till the moment when they are wanted to
be sessoned and set upon the table. The seasoning may be that already
mentioned3 or the juice of green grapes and salt, without anything else.
Towards the end of September, or beginning of October, walnuts are caten
raw, and the are good as long as they continue fresh ς that is, as long as it is
easy to detac the skin from them3 but when this cannot be removed, the nuts
become indigestible, and their aci-idity attacks the guma and the palate. In
order to preserve them fresh, they ought to be· buried‚ with their green shells
on, in saud or in dry soil, beyond the reach of frost or sui-face heat, in which
state they will continue fresh for six months. Of the dried kernels, a conserve
hradec is formed3 which, in France, is called ποιςαέ, and is considered very
ngreeable. 1n Spain, Evelyn tells us, they strew the gratings of old and hard
nuts over their tarts and sweetmeats. In London, young walnuts are much
used sor pickles, and in making catchupS, or adulterating soy, and other sauces.

Limerick gloves into a walnut shell, and a dish of walnuts with this kind of
kei-nel is sometimes presented at table. Thus furnished, they are osten sent
as resents to England ; and gloves are sent in the same manner from France.
