gamans: the latter especially frequently mention it. The filbert is said to
have been brought origmally from Pontus3 whence itwas called bqr-the Romans
Nux Pontica. The azel, or Nux Avelhna, we are told by irgil, in the
Georgia, was considered by the Romans to be as injurious to the vines, on
account of its spreadi root5‚ as the was forits pro ‘ty to browse on
the ἄζους shoots; antif-the keepers om vineyprds usetftegadacrifice the goat

they used hazel twigs to bind their vines. e common hazel was called by
the Romans Nux Aventina, from Avellino, a city in N aples3 where, Swinburne
tells us, in aster times, nuts were cultivated in such abundance‚ as, in favour-able
seasons, to roduce a rofit of 11,2501. “1 do not,” says Evelyn, “confound

to a miracle, and requires a strong saith. Let the curious, therefore, eonsuh
the philoso hical treatise of Dr. Vallemont (Physique Occult, ou m de
Ie Baguet ‹gustator-e), which will at least entertain them witha world of snr-
prising things.” The belief that certain gisted persons possessed the power οἷ
discoverin hidden water or metal, by means os a divining-rod‚ is as old as
the time o the Romans3 but the virgula Mercurialis was not always made of
hazel, or even of wood, but sometimes of brass or other metal. About the
fisteenth and sixteenth centuries, the art was called rhabdomanc 3 and persons
naturally 'sted for practising it were called rhabdomists. Τζε divinet took
a hazel r ‚ which was either curved or forked, and held it b the two ends,
so that its curvature was inclined outwards. 1f the person w o held the rod
possessed the power of rhabdomancy, and approached any metallic vein, or
other magnetic substance, or came near them, a slow rotatory motion of the
rod ensued in different directions, according to particular citcumstances. (See
Physicaland Histoffical Researcloee into Rlzabdomancy, &c.; Ekmenli di Electra-
metria Animak, ὅτε. διε.) In other cases, the rod was peeled, and then laid
on the palm of the hand, with the but end of the twig on the pulse of the
wrist; and the diviner moved slowly along, till the rod pointed to the desired
place; the rhabdornist feeling, at the same time, either a violent accelffation
or retardation of the pulse, and a sudden sensation of great heat or great eold-
