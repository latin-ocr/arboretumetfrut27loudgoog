generally known, that one of the elm trees standing near the entrance of the

assage leading to S ring Gardens was planted by the Duke of Gloucester,

hrother to Charles f As that unfortunate monarch was walking with his

guarda from St. James's to Whitehall, on the morning of his execution, he

turned to one of his attendants, and mentioned the circumstance, at the same·
time pointing out the tree.” (Jesse's Glean„ ed series, . 273.)

he was almost coeval, and whi in freshness and tranquillity afforded most

suitable emblema of his own green and venerable old .'’ ln heland, the

dimensions of several elrns are recorded by Hayes, whic , though the species

is not named, we think belong to U. eampestris. Near Arklow, at Shelton,

an elm had a truuk 5 st. 4- in. m diameter at the sursace of the ground. At

Luttrelstown, an elm b the road side girted 18 st. lOin. at the ground, and

had a straight truuk 40 . h· . In the county of Kildare stood an elm, which,

till the year 1762, was, per , the {inest tree of the s cies in the world.

The diameter of the head, ἔξω from the extremities o the lower branches,

exceeded 34 yards; but in the end of that year the two principal arms fell from

the truuk in one night, apparently from their own weight, as the westher was

fffectly calm. The timber contained in these branches alone sold sor 5 guinem.

this situation the tree continued till the winter of 1776, when a violent storm ’

tore up the whole by the roots, with a great mass os soil and rock adhering to
them. Some time prenous to this the trunk had been carefiilly measured,
and was found to be aeft. 6in. in circumference. It had been hollow for
some ears3 and the value of its timber by no means answered what might
