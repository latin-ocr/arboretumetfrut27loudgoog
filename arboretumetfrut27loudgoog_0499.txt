term never can apply to our English ofin He supposes that it belongs
to Q. s. ubescens, consoundipg, as Mer-tyn does, that variety with Q.
Tafim'n, wssich is not even a native of Butam, and is by no means common
on the Continent; but, as the wood of Q. sessiliflora approaches neat-er to
that of Q. Tatizin than the wood of Q. pedunculata, our own opinion is,
that Willdenow and Burnet have approached nearer to the truth than
Smith.

We have, however, deemed it most convenient to follow Linnaeus, in adopt·
ing the term Robur to designate a group of closely allied species, or perhaps

of both species. Both are described by Smith as lar e trees ς and by
Willdenow as trees growin from 30 st. to sost. high, an as enduring for
500 years. According to sc (Mem. sur les Che‘nes, δια), Q. sessihflora
may be known by its· spreading branches, and Q. pedunculata by its com-
paratively fastigiate branches and pyramidal form. Some, on the contrary,
assert that Q. sessiliflora becomes a lostier and more pyramidal tree than
Q. pedunculhta3 and this is said to be particularly the case in Wyre
Forest, where, it is stated by ΜΓ. Pearson, gardener to W. L. Childe, Esq„
one of the rincipal proprietors of the forest, to be almost as different m

of growth of the two species ς because we have found individuals of the one
