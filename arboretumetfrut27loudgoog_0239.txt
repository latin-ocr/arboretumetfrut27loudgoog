Lewin, the writer

of the article,

gives it ar hia

opinion that ‘ the

catepillar does

not enter the -

wood tiuthe second yearof iteown ageg’ and heatntes aa a reasomthat,

‘among all the numerous larvae he has found from June ιο November, he

could perceive but a ⁰ ht difference in aize. Poesibly, therefore, they may

foed on the tendet· bar of the aallow root the first year nster they are

hatched.’ ” This, Mr. Bree thinks, is very probably the caaeg for headda that

he hae not observed in the wood any perforatione of a very amali aize, or

auch as have the appearance of havmg been made by caten-pinara newiy
