has been supposed, in allusion to the leaves of the kinds of which it is con-
stituted turnin black in drying, but to mark their affinity to S. nigricans
Smith, a well nown individual of their number. (Borm- in ‚Eng. Boe.
Suppl„ t. 2795.) ln this case, it may be supposed that the characters of S.
ni ‘cans Smith are pretty well representatum of those of each of the kinds
ο the roup. Some of the characters of S. ni ⁰ ans Sma'th are described
below, 0. 108. According to ΜΓ. Borrer ( ng. Bot. Suppl. t. 2729.) it
is doubtful, in application to almost every kind of the group, whether it

himself not acquamted with all the inds of that group and ι and
that he ma , therefore, have placed some of them wrongly. It ma in·

that ,several os ‘the kinds distinguished by Schleicher also belong to this
daruascena For-bes andv S. Borrertdua Smith. Relativel to the principle of
rendering species in the willows thus comprehensive, r. Borrer makes the
following remark in Eng. Bot. Suppl„ t. 2702.:— ‘⁶ We have repeatedly
disclaimed all dogmatical decision as to what are species among the willows;
nor have we ever denied the probability that many of those which, in the
present state of our knowledge, we think it expedient to ropose as distinct
may be, in reality, mere seminal varieties or h ybrids. 'fllia being admitted,
the further admission can scarcely be withheld, that those botanists may

has added, “ Of these sac-ild princeps is Koch, whose lucid De salicibus
Europaeis commentatio displays a most intimate acquaintance with his
subject.'’ With r d to the details of Koch’s ad‘udication of the above-
cited species S. p ylicifolia, ΜΓ. Borrer gives t e following corrective
noticeS, which, for·
UnderS. damascena Forbes,E . Bot. u l..t.2709.‚it'is remarked,“Kocb
would, no doubt, refer S. damasc na, as heldsses its affinities, S. Andersonidna,
S. nigricans, &c., to Wahlenberg‘s S. phylicifolia3 bnt those botanists would
scarcely have a pro riated the name to willows of this set, had the been
aware of the act at the original Lapland s ⁶ en of S. ph li ' lia in
the Linnaean herbarium is indubitably, as was ong since stat by Smith,
the S. phylicifolia of Eng. Boc, t. 1958. This last is united by Koch, with
numerous affinities, to S. arbuscula ofWahlenberg, which he regards as the
S. arbfiscula of the Linnaean Flora Suecica.” Under S. tenuiffilia Smith this
remark occurs in Eng. But. Suppl„ t. 2795. :- “ S. tenuifolia and S. rupes·
tris are so nearly allied, that we cannot undertake to point out satisfactory
distinctions; yet Koch laces S. tenuifolia under S. arbuscula, and S. ru-
pestris under S. phylicifo ⁶ ” Under S. petrae³a Eng. Boc. S 1., t. 2725..
is this remark: — ‘⁶ It is surely b error that Koch bas plac S. πὶ
under his S. arbuscula, with S. phy ” “ clia of Smitb; and not under ⁸ own
S. phylicifolia, with S. Ammanniana and its affinitiess’
