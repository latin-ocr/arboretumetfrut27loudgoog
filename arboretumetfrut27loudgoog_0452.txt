Gerqgrqphy.g The common birch is a native {f the colder regions of the
old Continent3 and also, as we think (under the form of Β. pepulimus,
and other kinds, treated by botanists as species), throughout goeat part of
North America. It is found in Asia, in Siberia, as far as the Altaic Moun-
tains; and also in the Himalayas 3 but not in Africa. According to Pallas, the
birch is more common than any other tree, throughout the whole of the Rus-

In some parts of Russia‚ immense tracts are covered with this tree alone. In
the neighbourhood of Moscow, it forms the prevailing tree in all the woods
belonging to the country residences of the nobles, and it may be seen in the
foreground offig. 1551„ which is a view of the Lake of Petrovskoye, which, in

1814, when we made the sketch, was one of the most celebrated “ English
pleasure-grounds ” in that art of the Russian empire. In Europe, Dr. dh
observes, the region of Sne birch is bounded only by vegetation its . It
is found from Iceland to Mount Etna: in the [celandic forestu its limita are
only those of vegetation3 but on Mount Etna it is not h' her than 5600 ft.
above the level of the sea, its range being about 1000 ft. t is found on the
whole line of the Apennines, in the kingdom of Naplm, (where it commences
at the height of4761st. above the level of the sea,) and at the height of
6100 st. forms little woods. (Co . Boe. M ., l. p. 91.) It is also found on
most of the high mountains esame south o‘ngurppe · on Mount Caucasus,
in Bucheria, on the eastern shores of the Caspian ἕως in Kamtschatka,
in foresta at lat. 580 rm in Dahuria, in J apan, and in West Greenland. (Dec.)
Von Buch considers the birch to r uire a mean tem arature of about
26ο of Fahr. In Lapland, according to t e same author, e line of birches is'
1937 st. below the line of eternal snow, and 802 ft. above the boundary ofthe
Scotch pine. At Hosperdet, in abay of the Icy Sea, the common birch is a low
bush3 but at Alten it becomes a lofty tree, forming woods. (Schouw in Gar-d.
M ., vol. xii. p. 60.) On the Alps, in Switzerland, it is never found at above
the eight of 4400 st. (M. Alphonse De Candolle in Gar-d. Mag„ vol. xii. p. 234.)
B. alba appears in North America under the form of Β. populiffflia, which,
though by many-botanists considered as a distinct species, yet we cannot help

· thinking is no more than a ver distinct variety of the birch of Europe.

(See No. 2.) Β. p ila and Β. glaqffulosa, also found in North Amen-ica, are,
probabl , nothing mo're than varienes of Β. alba. In Britain and Ireland, it
is foun almost every where on mountain: and in poor sandy soils3 reaching
