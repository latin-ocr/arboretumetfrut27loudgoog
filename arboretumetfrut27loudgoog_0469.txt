marked than this, which appears, however, rarely to
have found a place in collectione. Its leaves are nearly
as large as those of the canoe birch B. papyracea„
and the are remarkably angular. he sti ules are
unusual y large, and more resemble those o the pla-
tanus than the birch.” (Penny Cycl.)

The most northerly situation in which this tree
is found in the United State· is in New Jersey,
about 10 miles from New York3 but it is abundant
in Maryland, Virginia, the upper part of the Carolinas,
and in Georgia. It is not, like the other species,
found growi in the midst of the forest, but only on
the banks o rivers, accompanied by the Platanus
occidentalis, spcer eriochrpum, and some species of '
willow. It grows, with the reatest luxuriance, on the ,
sides of limpid streams whic have a gravelly bed, 8ηά .
the banks of which are not marshy. The wood of ψ
the red birch is compact, and very nearly white; 8ηά
the colour of the sap wood and the heart wood is very nearly the same.
Like that of the juneberry (Amelcinchier Botryapium), it is longitudinally
marked by red vessels, which intersect each other in different directions. The

intense heat.” For this reason, he recommends it for cultivation in Italy,
and, we may add, for the temperate regions of Australia. In the climate of
London, it scarcely attains 8 timber-like aize3 but there is a tree of it at Syon,
of which we have given a portrait in our last volume, which is 47 ft. hi h3 one
in the Fulham Nursery, which died in 1834, was 30 st. high ς 8ηά one at roome,

From this circumstance, it can never be mistaken for any other species of
birch, either in winter or summer. The bark which comes nearest to it is
that of B. daurica, as re resented in the engraving of the trunk of an old
tree of that species in Pal ’s Flora Rossica. There are lants at Messrs.
Loddiges’s, and in several of the London nurseries. ey are generally
raised from imported seed„ but seeds ripen in this country, when the tree
has attained the age of six or eight years. Planta, in the London nurseries‚
are from ls. to ls. δά. each; and seeds ls. per quart. At New York, plants
are 25 cents each, 8ηά seeds l dollar 8ηά 60 cents per pound, 50 cents per
quart, or 8 dollars per bushel.
