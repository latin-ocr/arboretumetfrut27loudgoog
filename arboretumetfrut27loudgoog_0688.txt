8811, from which the insect escaped, must necessarily contain 1888 “ t
principle than one which has its interior less consumed by the insect, w '
still remains enclosed therein3 and hence it is that there are two kinds of gall
nuts known in commerce= those which still contain the inaect, and which are
known in the trade under the names of black or blue 88118 and green galls, and
termed yet-li by the natives of the countries where they are collected ς and
those from which the insect has esca , und which are called white

former, and are of 8 pale brown or whitish colour, less compact, and not so

Mrvhi‘ ulloch states that OEese 88118 “are priucipelly exported from ,
Tripoh, Sm and Saidz those brought from the first come chiefly m
Mosul, ou e western bank of the Tigris, about 10 days' journey from Aleppo.
The real Mosul galls are unquestionably the best of any: but all that are
gathered in the surrounding country are sold under this name. Those from
Caramania are of ver inferior quality. The {all nuts met with in India are
carried thither from ersia by Arabian merc ants.'’ (Com. Dia-t„ p. 595.
General Hardwicke, however, states that he discovered the tree upon whic
they are found in the neighbourhood of Adwuanie. (As-iat. Rep„ vol. vi.
p. 376.) “ The price of galls, in the London markets, varies from 658. to
858. per cwt. The duty is 58. r cwt.” (Meua. Com. Dict„ art. GalL) The
white aud blue 88118 are gen ly sold mixed together in about equal propor-
tions, aud are then called 88118 in sorts 3 and occasionally fraud is attempted
by dyeing the white galls with a blue dye, but their lighter weight will render

of which is prevented by the addition of a roper uantit of gum arabic. This
is usually accounted for by the superior nity o the gafiic acid3 which, com· -

precipitate with solution of gelatine. The oportion o these ingredients in
