De la Peyrouse, the sweetest acorns are found on trees which grow in warm
dry situations. In the climate of London, seedling planta grow with eonsi-
derable rapidity; attaining, in good loamy soil, from 15 ft. to 20 ft. in height

Geogroplty. The Quercus Plex is a native of the south of Europe and the
north of Africa. It is very common in Spain 8ηά Italy3 and 18 indigenous,
to France, as far north as Nautes and Angers. According to Bosc, it never
grows in 11188888 like foresta ς . 1181 it is dispersed here 8ηά there among other
trees, more especially on hilly grounds, and near the sea. C 'n S. E.
00011 says that it grows in the first, or low and humid, region of pain ς and,
alone, serves to indicate the «1111818888 of climate of that part of the peninsula.
In Sicily, it abounds on the hille all along the coast, and ascends Mount Etna

well close by t e 888 shore, where no other European 0811 will thrive.

His . This tree was well known to the 8118181118. Pliny mentions some
holm 8 in existence when he wrote, which, according to his statement,
must have then been, at the lowest computation, 1400 01· 1500 years old.
One tree, he says, grew in the Vatican, and was older than Rome itself. It
had brazen letters, 111 1118 ancient Etruscan characters, fixed upon its trunkg
from which it would appear, that, before the city was founded, or 81811
the Roman name was known, this oak was 8 sacred trec. 'three other ilexes,
he recorda, were 8180 then extant 011 1118 8118 of the ancient city of Tibur.
The Tiburtines, he adds, were a more ancient people 111811 1118 Romans, and
their city, Tibur, was founded ages before Rome: yet these oaks were older
81811 than Tiburtus, who built it ; for tradition asserts that they were the
sacred trees 011 which that hero beheld an omen, which he regarded as a wan-ant
from the gods 88 to the spot on which to found his city. Now, Tiburtus ·
was the reputed 8011 of Amphiaraus, who died at Thebes 100 ears before
the Trojan war3 and how long these 08118 outlived Pliny, who ourished in
the latter halfof the first cen of the Christian era, we have no record.

He also mentions the acorns in'the fourth Geor-gie, p. 81. Horace also speaks

easily be procured3 and Pliny states that the Romans sometimes made their
civic crowns of it. The earliest notice which we have of the Q. Plex in Bri-
tain is by Gerard, who, writing in 1597, says that “it is 8 stranger in England,
notwithstanding there is here and there a tree thereof that hath been procured
from beyond the 8888.” Johnson, in his edition of Gerard, published in 1636,
s'ays that 0188188, 111 1581, “ observed two trees3 0118 in a garden about the
