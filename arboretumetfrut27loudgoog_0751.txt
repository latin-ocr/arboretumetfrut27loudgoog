the climate ia rather improved, and the spirit os planting become more general,
this, he thinks, may give encouragement to more extended lanting of the

' ‘ observor, though, in this case, he has mixed up facts that have come

er his own observation with the current opinion respecting the use of
chestnut timber in old buildings, and in the Spanish navy, remarks, with Bosc,
that the timber, though a good deal similar to that of the oak, is not “quite -
so reedy and elastic, but is destitute of the large laminae, or platea (flosh),
which, radiating from the ith to the outside, become so rominent to view in
the oak‚ when the tudina! section is parallel to the p e of the laminae.”
(Nan. Ἰῖω.. p. 47.) e have quoted these different opinions, for the purpose
of showing that the ground on which British authors hitherto have recom-
mended the culture of the chestnut aa timber is the erroneous position
that the roofs of many of our ancient buildings are formed of it ς that, on
the faith os this, Evelyn, and others of then, appear to haveat-gued in its
favour, contrary to their own experience.

The following remarks on the propertiea and uses of the chestnut by ΜΓ.
Nathaniel Kent, a well-known and highly respected land and timber surveyor‚
are dated 1792, and were published in the tenth volume of the stmactionae
osche Society ο] Aris. They seem to us to contain all that can be said, from
practieal experiente in favour of the chestnut as a timber tree in Britain. “ln
1676,” Mt. Kent observes, ‘⁸ an ancestor of the present Mr. W‘mdham of
Felbriffl, in Norfolk, had the merit of being a considerable planter of chestnut.
In the space os 50 years, it is presumed, these plantatione required thinning,
ss his successor, about that time, began to apply this timber to useful purposes
upon his estate. The first aceount is of the branch or limb of a chestnut‚ about
13 in. square, which, in the year 1726, vas put down as a hanging·post for a
gate, and carried the m without alteration, 52 years; when, upon altering
the enclosures of the where it stood, it was taken up under my direction,
and appearing to be perfectly sound, was put down sor a clappmgspost in
another plaee. In 1743, a large barn was built with some of this timber, and

were put down, which 1 have since seen removed ς and, aster standing 30 or 40
years, they generall appeared so sound, as to admit of being set up in some
other place. The ast instance 1 shall mention, though not of long date, will
show the great su riority of this timber over oak in fences. ln the year 1772,
the present Mr. indham made a plantation in his park, which was
fenced with osts and rails, converted rom young oaks and chestnuts of the
same age an scantling, such as were picked out of a place where they stood
too thick. Last year, upon ΜΓ. Windham’s enlarging this plantation, it was

more apt to crack and fly into splinters, than any other: but 1 have never
known thisto be the case with young chestnut.” Hence, he directs the tree
to be cut when it is in' a growing or healthy state; because it is “so earl
useful, that, if it be cut when it uares only 6 in.,it will be as durable as an
