the chene noir of secundat, pl. 5., as a synonyme to this variety ;
but we have satisfied ourselves, from examining the platea in
Secondan that his Chene noir is the Q. Ταύείπ of Pei-soon, and
Bosc is of the same opinion. Willdenow tes the Chene
noir of Secondat as a synonyme of his Q. pu cens in his Ber-
Iinische Baumzucht, ed. 1811, p. 349.; but not in his Abbildang, διο..
ublished in 1819. Professor Burnet falls into the same error as
rofessor Mat-tyn, in considet-ing the Q. ubescens of Willdenow to
be the Chene noir of Secondat, and the nereus cum 1611 ‘ pediculo

synonyme of the Durmast oak3 and stating that he thinks the ap-

ether Q. pubescens Willd. and the Durmast oak are synonymes,
we are not quite certain, though we have very little doubt on the
subject. There is a trec with this name in the Horficultural So-

hood of Paris.’' It seems that this variety is known in the Laudes under
the name of Auzin‚ or Chene de malediction3 because the country people
there believe that any one who euts down one of these trees, or who sleeps
in a house built with any of the timber, will die within the year. Bosc had
never seen this variety, though he had traversed the country where it is said

In Britain, the varieties are very numerous, though none has hitherto
received a technical designation, except the durmast‚ just described3 respect·
