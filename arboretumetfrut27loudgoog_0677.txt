au elongated oval form, nearly black,
and are contained in greyish pedun-
culated cu . The fruit is sometimes

acorns are found on the trees wi
the radicle unfolded. In British gar-
dens, this tree is no where found
higher than a large shrub, it requiring
rather a warmer climate to attain a
timber-like size. There is a tree at
Kew, between 40 ft. and 50 st. high ς
and a handsome small tree at the
Duke of Devonshire's, and some in
the Hackney arboretum. In the
neighbourhood of Paris, the live oak and Q. aquatica, Bosc informs us, ars
the only two American species that are found to be tender.

Geograplny and Histoi-2 . The live oak is confined to the maritime parts
of the southern states oll North Ameria, where it is known by the name of
the live oak. Its most northern boundary is Norfolk, in Virginis. “ From
Norfolk it spreads along the coast for a distance of 1500 or 1800 miles, ex-
tending beyond the mouth of the Mississippi. The sea air seems essential to

states ς and on the fertile islanda, which lie in great numbers scattered along
the coasts for several hundreda of miles. ‘⁸ 1 frequently saw it,” says Michaux,
“ upon the beach, or half-buried in the movable sands upon the downs, where
it had preserved its freshness and vigour, though exposed during a long lapse
of time to the fury of the wintry tempest, and to the ardour of the summer’s

by Banister, and ιι was by called Q. sempervirens. Catesby, in his
Natural History qs Car-olim, p. 17„ describes it as a yramidal tree, 40 ft. high,
in the salt marshes of carolina. He adds that t e aeorns are remarkably
sweet, and were used by the Indians to thicken their venison sonp. and for
expressing an oil, which was ver much like the oil of sweet almonds. The
first record of this tree that we ave in England is, that it was in cultivation
by Miller in 17393 but it does not appear to have been much planted, as we
have not received an account of any old trees of this species now existing in
England. In Amen-ica, there is said to be a very large live oak at Goose
Greek, near Charleston, which mensures 415sp in circumference close to the
ground, and 18 ft. 6 in. at its smallest pertz· its largest limb is 12 st. 6in. in
