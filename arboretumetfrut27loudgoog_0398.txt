P. alba and P. (a.) canescens. It ns plentiful in the neighbourhood

of streams in Tauria and Caucasus; whence it appears to have been ·

introduced into Britain ia 1816. There is a female plant of this
kind in the Horticnltural Society’s· Garden, and young planta, in
Loddiges’s arboretam.

P. palmata Hort.; is a very distinct variety of P. alba, with the
leaves broad, and deeply lobed, like those of some kinds of A‘cer.

Ξ Ρ. a. 4· arembergica, P. arembergica Lodd. Cat„ 1836, seems identical
with P. ἵε.) acerimum but the plante in Loddiges’s collection, which

⁸ were on y received in 1835, are so small, that it is ‚difficult to
decide with certainty respecting them. Booth (Gara. Mag.. xi.
p. 207.)describes it as growi much more rapidl y than the old variety.

ἲ Ρ. a. 5 belgica, P. belgica Lo . Cat„ ed. 1836, is also a kind removed
from the Continent in 18353 but the planta in Messrs. Loddiges’s
collection are too small to. admit of our stating anything more re-
specting them, than that they are evidently a variety of P. alba5
probably identical with P. a. acerifolia.

Ξ Ρ. a. 6 candicans, P. candicans Lodd. Cat.. ed. 1836, is a strong-‘growing
variety of P. alba3 probabi also identical with P. acerisolia. This
is the P. tomentha of the {Iawick N ursery‚ and the hoary poplar of
the Edinburgh nurseries‚ where it is propagated by layers, ivhich
make shoots 6 ft. or 8 ft. long the first season.

Ἰ Ρ. a. 8 (egyptiaca {lora Ρ. a. 'uida-Hert„ the Egyptian white poplar,
is a much weaker-growing pght than any of the preceding varieties;
though we have received s imens of this kind snm the Hawick

Nursery, and seen a tree 'ng this name in the Horticultural
Society's Garden, we can say very little about it. Messrs. Archibald
· Diokson and Son, of Hawick, state that it is unfit for planting for

forest purposes.

Other Varieties. The late Professor Mertens of Bremen (as M. Fis-
cher of Gottingen infor-med us in 1835) planted a number of different
sorts of poplar on the ramparts of Bremen3 and,in 1816, specimens
of these were sent to Sir J. E. Smith, which are now in the herbarium Α
of the Linum Society. Of· these specimens‚ the mon remarkable is

Des ‘ tion, 6-0. The white poplar, and its different varieties, form trees
from affl. to 100 ft. high, and upwards‚ generally with a clear trunk to a con-
siderable height, and a ε’ reading head, usually, in full-grown trees, but thinly
clothed with foliage. T e roots creep under the surface to a considerable
distance from the tree, and send up suckers in abundance. The leaves of all
the varieties are white underneath3 those of P. (a. canescens least sog and
those of P. a. nivea, and P. a. candicans, so in t e greatest degree. The
leaves of the largest-growing varieties·of the abele tree, are deeply lobed and
indented3 very dark above, and very white and downy hemath, with foot-
stalks about lin. in length. The young shoots have a purplish tinge, and ⁹
they are covered with a white down3 but the bark os the trunk and of the
