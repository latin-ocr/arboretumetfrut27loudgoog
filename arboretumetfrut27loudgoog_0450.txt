Other Varietx'es. B: populifolia and B. daurica, given below as species,
are, we think, as much vaneties as the preceding sorts3 for, tho h B. popu-
lifolia will come tolerably true from seed. yet itis often produ from seeds
of the common birch. B. daurica appears to be a variety of B. alba, stunted
from the climate in which it grows; and the same observation will apply
to B. sibirica,.and some others, enumerated in the Cata-logne os Messrs.
Loddiges for 1836. Β. excelsa and B. nigra of some of the London gar-
dens are mere varieties of the common birch, and quite distinct from the
species described by botanists under these names, which are natives of
America- (See θανά. Mag„ vol. xi. . 502. 689.) There are some other
sorts in the collection at Messrs. oddiges’s3 such as B. undulata, B.
Thouinidaea and B. Fischern'i, which appear to us to belong to B. alba ; but,
the planta being exceedingly small, we are not able to determine this with

Kianyn s Miller ,· but, unless we are right in conjectat-ing B. pumila to be
the last, we have not seen an of them. Dr. Agat-dh mentions “ three
singular varieties with laciniateg leaves (B. hybrida Moenda) near Fahlun.
- (Gar-d. Mag„ vol. xii. p. 63.) The birch varies so much from abed, that
scarcely any limita can be given to the number of sorts that might be
selected from a seed-bed. ln extensive birch soi-ests, also, whether m the
rocky scener of Sweden, the bogs in the north os Russia, or on the hills of
Germany, f own trees may be seen, as various in their foliage and habit
of growth as ᾗ young plants in seed-heda. For this reason, we are in-
clined to think that there are only· two Euro ean species of birch, B. alba
