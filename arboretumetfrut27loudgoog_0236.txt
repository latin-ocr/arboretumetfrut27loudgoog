that season, in order that the walks may be used without the rislt of damping
the feet. For the same reason, also, when it can be accomplished, the salictum
should not be at any great distance from the shrub or the {lower-garden.
Let us suppose a collection os a hundred sorts of wil ows, planted in good
soil, with sufficient room to assume their natural sizes and shapes; that the
plants have been ten ears planted ς 8ηά that they are all in flower, or coming
into flower3 and we s all readily imagine that a scene of so much of a particular
kind of beauty 8ηά s lendour has never yet been presented to the botanist or the
lover of gardening. gor such 8 salictum, two or three acres would be r uisite;
but these, we should think, might easily be spared in the pai-ks of weal y pro-
prietors in England‚ or in the grounds of gentlemen having residences in the
mountainous districts of Wales and Scotland.

Ace-idents, Diseases, ami Insecu. The willow is subject to few accidents or
diuersae-53 but it is liable to be attaclted by many insecta. Salix fragilis
Mathew states to be subject, in Scotland, to a disease similar to what the
canker is in the apple tree. This disease, he says, is generally concentrated in cer-
tain of the bark 8ηά alburnum of the trunk3 aportiou of the branches above
whic witherS, 8ηά the uppermost boughs, after a time, assume the pearance
of a stag’s head and horns; which, from the indestructibility of t ese dead
branches‚ the tree retains for many years ς 8ηά hence the name of stag’s-head
osier, which is applied to this species. This disease, and other causes, espe-
cially in old trees, give rise to rottenness in the trunk3 which, in the willow,
from its being comparatively a short-lived tres, takes place, more especially in
wet soils, much sooner than in most other species. Mr. mentions §Kalq
p. 522), that he found lime produce canker in the twigs o basket wil ows3

p One(of thes earliest notices of insects injurious to willows is given b anil·
liam Curtis,in vohi. of the Linnoean Raucae-tium, published in 1791. his article
we consider so interesting and instructive, that we shall here give it almost entire.
It was read before the Linnaean Societyin November, 1788:—“ Several species
of willow, articularly three of the most useful and ornamental, the S. alba,
the S. fragilis, and the S. babylonica, are well known to be subject to the
d redations of numerous insects, and of the larvae of the Cossus Ligniperda
(ffieady described as attacking the elm, see p. 1386.) in particular, which feed
on the substance of the wood, and prove uncommonl destructive to the
latter species ς for, as the larvae ineach tree are ly numerous, in the
course of a few years they desti-oy so much o the trunk, that the first
violent gale of wmd blows down the tree. So infested are the weeping
willows, in many nurseries, with these insects, that scarcely one in ten can be
selected free from them.” The willows are infested, also, in the same wa by
the larvae of thc Cerambyx moschatus3 8ηά also by those of a s ‘es o the
Curculionidae, which was little suspected of committing similar epredations,
but which, in pro ortion to its size, is no less destructive than those of the
Cerambyx and Cgssus. The larvae of a species of Nitidula [Silpha L.] are
also found to be injurious in a similar manner to those above named.

In the beginnin of June, 1780, Mr. Curtis observed a young tre⁸e of the
salix viminalis, w 'ch had been planted in his garden two years, and which
was about 6 in. in diameter, throwing out from various parts of its trunk
a substance somewhat resembling sawdust, which fell at its base in no incon-
siderable quantit . This substance, on a closer examination, was found to
proceed from ho es about the size of a goose-quill, penetrating d ly into-the
substance of the wood, obliquel upwards and downwards. Ἣ its first
coming out, it appeared of the co our of the wood, and was moist3 and as it
