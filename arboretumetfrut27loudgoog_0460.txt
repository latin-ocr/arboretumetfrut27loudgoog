country people, and sold to the nurserymen. Tlus is, indeed, the mode by
which young trees and h . plants of every kind were obtained before the
establishment of commersi nursenes. Young birch lants which have been

extensively, “ are found to root much better than seedlings of the same age
and size taken out of ‘a regular seed-bed; doubtless because, in the latter
case, a greater proportion of the taproot requires to be cut off. In the ease

of the young birches ulled out of the copses, the taproot‚ which could not
get far down into the Bar-d soil, ‘has its substance in a more concentrated form,
and is more branchmg 3 hence, httle requires to be cut off it, except the
rootlets, or fibres ς and it may be considered as acting as a bulb to the u
part of the lant. The to s of these seedling birches are shortened be ore
planting; and, the plants, . Young informs us, make as much wood in one
year as regular nursery-reared birch seedlings will in two. It is found in this
of the country, tbat the down -leaved black-barked seedling birches
B. a. pubescens) stole much more heely, when cut down ss eo pice-wood,
than the smooth-leeved white-barked weeping variety B. a. pendula). (See
Gard. Mag„ vol. xi. p. 506.) It appears srom Boutc er, that this mode of
obtaining young birch trees, was formerl practised in Scotland.
ln France and Germany, plantations o birch are frequentl made by sowing
the seed where the trees are intended finally to remam. or this purpose
the oorest soils are harrowed in humid westher, in the mouth of October, or
of ovember, and 151b. of seed, as it is taken from the catkins along with
the scales, is sown on an acre, and asterwards covered with a bush harrow.
Where the ound is under corn, the seed is sown with the last corn crop, as
clover is in ngland 3⁷ and, where it abounds with weeds and bushes, these are
set fire to, early in the autumn, and the seed sown as soon afterwards as it is
thered from the trees. It is observed by Michaux, that bumt soil is pecu-
