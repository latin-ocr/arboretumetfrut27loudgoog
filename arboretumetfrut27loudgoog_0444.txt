over the surface of the ground under a seed-bearing alder tree in autumn, aster
the seed had dropped. When the seed is sown in autumn, the plante will
come up the following spring; and, when it is sown in spring, they will gene-
rally come up in the course of five or six weeks aster sowing. Spring sowings
should be made much thicker than autumna] aowin ς because many of the
seeds, unless they have been very carefully exclude from the air, lose their
vital power during winter. The plants stom spring-sowa seeds will attain the
height of from 3 ιιι. to 6 in. the first summer. The second year they will be
double or treble that height5 andin three or four yearS, if properly treated, they
will be 5st. or 6 ft. h1gh. The nursery culture and after-man ement in
