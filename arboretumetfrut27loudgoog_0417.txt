Paper-tier and Um, Soet, Propagation, ᾆσ. The wood may be applied to
the same purposes as that of the species reviously described; but,.being of
larger dimensions, it ma be considered as tter fitted for being used in build-
ings. Pontey observes t at the tree is not only an astonishingly uick grower‚
but that its stem is remarkably straight 3 and that, with very ⁶ ing attention
to side pruning, it may be kept clear of branches to any required height. For
these reasons, he considers it the most profitable of all trees to plant in messes
in a fertile soil, rather moist. Sir J. E. Smith describes the tree as very
hardy in Britain, and valuable for lanting in exposed situations, or on poor
sandy soil; but he adds that the female tree is objectionable, the down of
the seeds being a great nuisance, particularly near houses3 as it sticks to
clothes and furniture in a most troublesome manner. Hence, the male
trees should be selected, not only for-planting near a house, but wherever
ornament is the main object3 as the flowers, which are os a deep red, and
produced in great abundance, are as ornamental as those os P. nigra; while
the female flowers of both s ies are comparatively inconspicuous‚ and the
seeds alike cottony and trou lesome. Were ever cottager to grow his own
fuel, there is, perhaps, no tree that would succeed' so well for that purpose,
on a small spot of ground, as P. monilil‘era. (See Gard. M ., vol. vi.
p. 146.) Cuttings of the black Italian poplar root more freely an those
of the Canadian poplar3 and this, indeed, constitutes, in our opinion, one
of the most important differences between the two trees. The caterpillars

pillar (a), which is green and brown‚ when disturbed, shoots out of the end of
its forked‘ tail two sol't orange-coloured threads. Early in August, having
become much larger (b), it sheds its skin, and turns green striped with white.
ln a few days, it encloses itself in a case made of chips of the wood (c),
which it attaches to a branch‚ and which looks somewhat like a slug, out of
which the moth (d) makes its escape at one end.
