mrtem from this oil, which are too hard and husky to be eeten, are med
for making torches3 and hence the name of tour-teau, which is gmenlly

plied to a torch, or link, in France. In those districts of Englnnd where
ege beech tree abounds in natural forestu, it m‘ t, perhaps, be worth while
to make beech oil for private use, both as 8 su titute for olive oil, and for
lamp oil. By steeping the mast in water for several hours, and afterwards
kiln-drying them, both the outer husk and inner skin would probably be euily
removed 18 8 common flour-mill, or in some coarse portsble mill 3 and the
kernels might be ground in 8 finer mill previously to expressing the oil from
them. To prevent disappointment, however, as to the quantity of oil pro-
duced, ' must be recollected that the summers of d are less iiivoursble
to the oleaginous secretions of plants than those of rauce.

For usq‘ul Pluuialiam, the beech is not highly prized3 thetree not being of
much value when young, not forming a permanent coppice-wood, end the
bark being of little value. Beech of small size, or of short and crooked stem,
Mathew observes, is the least valusble of all timber. On dry chalky soils, it
may be planted asa timber tree3 but here, as in many other cases where 8
straight clean trunk is wanted, the plants require to be drawn up, either b
other trees of their own species, or by trees of a different species, which
advance at nearly the same rate of growth3 such, for example, as the sweet
chestnut. The beech, however, succeeds best in plantations by itself; end,

haps, there is no membranaceous-leeved tree which, in 8 wild stete in
orests, is found so little intermixed with other ‘es. It is one of the
worst of 811 trees for hedgerows, not only injuring ape fence und the adjoining
crops by the density of its shsde3 but its trualt, when grown in this situation,
being neither long, clean, nor st ⁸ ht, is of little velue except for fuel.
Another disadvantsge attending thrgnfieoeh, in hedgoeows, is, that it does not
resist the sea breeze; thou , aster a certain period of time, the beech tree, like
most others in which the ead has grown 811 to one side, 1188 the wer of

8 rationale of the process will be found generalised in our Eueydopoediaff
Arbor-inultm. In Normandy, Bosc informs us, it was formerly the custom to
plant the beech round villages‚ in order to shelter them from stormsg the
tree, from the upright tendency of its branches, affording less levernge to the
wind, and, by the bulk and compactness of its head, opposing a greater body

the stools er 40 or ⁵0 years3 owing, as it 18 supposed, to the extreme hard-
ness which the bark acquires diuing that period. Even to preserve 8 beech
coppice in vigour for any length of time, it is 88888881· to cut it more fre-

coppices, they are cut every sixth or seventh year, and the wood bumed into
charcoal, wh1ch is sold to the gunpowder manufacturers. In Germany, M.
Hartig has found that the beech does not push nearly so well stom the stool in
rich as in poor soi13 which, he conjectures, may be ο “ to the extraordinary
thickness and hardness of the berk, produced by the ex ee of sep, which,
111 ihgvsffiepffignegg· 111118αὲιὲἓάῗοὶἳὲ zmil-1³ ns eovferpae &a lumpgof har miili
is prevented from coming up. For this reason, Hartig recommends beech
coppices, on rich soils, to be cut when the sap is in motion3 because the qusn-
tity of sap being diminished by the loss that is then sustained, the stoolbecomes
more marly in the situation which it would be in if growing in a poor soil.

For Hedgerows for· shelter, and especially sor those lofty narrow hedges
which were formerly much in use for enclosing and sheltey‘ng gardens, or·
chards, and small fields for affording early grass, the beech has no equnl
among deciduous trees ς for, 88 Boutcher observes, by retaining its withered
leaves all the winter, it affords the same protection 88 88 evergreen. A beech
