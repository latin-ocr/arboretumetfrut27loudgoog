becomes distinct from the petio ος but it is always the case that one side of

from the first have clear straight stems, and aa they would ripen their wood
better, in consequence of growing slower than low trees or bushes, so they
would perhaps show blossoms and ripen fruit. Some years ago, Meesrs.
