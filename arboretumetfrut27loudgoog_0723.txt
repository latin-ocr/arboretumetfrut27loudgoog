quite narrow at the base,like the hornbeame but beech is greatly superior to e
hornbeam, in the richer colour of its foliage. In Belgium, particularly in the
village of St. Nicholas, between Ghent and Antw , very close and handsome
hedges are made with young beech trees, plant 7in. or Sin. apert, with
their heads inclining in ο posite directions, at an angle of 450, so as to crosa
one another at right angles, and thus form a wall of trelliswork, the open
nares of which are 51n. or 6in. on the side. During the first ear, the
ἔξω are bound together with osiers at the points ofintersection, where they
ly become grasted, and grow ιο ther. Dr. Neill found a hedge of this

a curve, which, though not picturesque, has a character of its own, which will
be found generally p easing. The leaves are beautiful in every period· of their
existence: nothing can be finer than their uansparent delicacy when expand-
ing, and for some weeks asterwards. In summer, their smooth texture, and
their deep yet-lively green, are highlytffatifyin tq the eye 3, and the warmth of
their umber tint, when they hang on e trees ‹glunng the winter sesson, as con-

desirable on the margin of pine and fir woods, or among evergreens generally3
more especially when the soil is somewhat good and moist3 under which cir-
cumstances alone will full-grown beech trees retain their leaves during the
winter. So desirable is the effect produced by the beech with its leaves on
in the winter season, that when the trees, stom age or any other cause, drop-
their leaves in autumn, we would recommend the substitutin of young trees,
which seldom fail to retain their leaves duri winter, ti they approach
towards a timber size. It is certain, however, t at some individual beeches
are much more apt to retain their leaves through winter than others3 for
which reason a sufficient number of young trees ought to be planted, to allow
of the rooting out of those which do not ’ answer the end in view. Beeeh

to the possessore of grounds of limited extent.

The leaves of the beech are less liable to be eaten, either by insects or by
cattle, than those os almost any other tree. The first circumstance rendere
the beech very desirable for situations near the eye, and for avenues and
hedges 3 and the second renders it one of the best park trees, since its
branches, though they are injured by cattle, are far less so than those of the
oak and the elm. Two other-circumstances which render this an excellent

and other birds. The denstty of its head m es ιι an excellent nightly
shelter for singing birds. The smoothness and light colour of the bark, and
the circumstance of the trunk being clothed with branches to within a short
distance of the round, render it a desirable tree to place a seat andei-3
the eye feeling tlie light colour of the smooth bark to be more enliven‘
than the dark rough-furrowed bak of the oak or English elm, the dar
smooth gloomy bark of the Scotch elm, the lichen-covered hoary bark of
the asb, or the reddish brown, cracked, and scaly bark -of the Seotch pine.
The only tree which can be compared to the beech, as one to sit under, is the

platanus 3 but the shade of this last tree is much less dense. The ancients
