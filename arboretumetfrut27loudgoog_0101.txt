Desa-qam, ᾶσ. Deciduous treet, nativae of Europe, Asia, and Amet-ica,
remrkable for their large leaves, which are mostly lobed, and which, in a state
os mltivation, are liable to great variation in pomt of magnitude, form, and
texture. They are easily propagated by weda, layers, cuttings, and trun-
chaom3 every part os the mu , like the olive, taking root easily, and

' ιῖι trae. All the species w· l serve to nom-ish the silkwormz but M.
‘ alba, and its varieties, are considered much the best for this purpose. In
vanu elimatas, such as Persia, the leaves of M. nigra are sufficieutly succulent
sor feeding the silkworm3 but in eolder countrioe they do not answer equally

well.
