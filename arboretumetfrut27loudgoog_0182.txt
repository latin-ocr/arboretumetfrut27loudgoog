vegetating Walnut. — This is a most valuable variety for those dis-
tricts where the frosts continue late in spring. In France, about
Paris, its leaves do not appear before the end of June3 but the fruit
ripens nearly as early as than of the other varieties. In the London -
Horticultural Society's Garden, there is a plant of this variety, δὴ.
or 6 st. high, which, on the lst of J ul y, 1835, when every other tree in
the gas-den was in leaf, had not burst a single bud.

Other Vadeties, The above are the most remarkable and valuable of the
varieties of the common walnut3 the first three, on account of their fruit 3
and the last, as a curiosity, on account of its leaves. But in the Bon Jordinier
five others are enumerated3 and in the Horticultural Societ ’s Fmit Cata-
Iogue for 1832 nine are given, of which the most valuable for cu tivation for its
fruit is the highssier3 a variety which was originated at Thetford, in Norsolk,
and which is held in much esteem in that county and in Suffolk. (Hori.
Trans„ iv. p. 517.; and Ε. ‘ff Gan-d„ ed. 1835, p. 942.) There is also the
Yorkshire walnut,' which is much planted in that county. The varieties
recommended by ΜΓ. Thom son, as having proved the most prolific in the
Horticultural Society’s Gar en, are, the round early oval ς the double large
French, No. l. above; the tendet-shelled, No. 2.; and the thick-shelled.

A variationi, worth notice, was displayed in a nut sent to us by Mr.
Samuel Taylor of Whittington, near Stoke Ferry, Norfolk, which had
nearly three perfect valves, but was devoid of kernel.

The leaves, when bruised, exhale a strong aromatic odour3 and, in the ex-
treme heat of summer, the exhalations from them are so powerful, as to
produce unpleasant effects upon some persons, if they slulnber under the
