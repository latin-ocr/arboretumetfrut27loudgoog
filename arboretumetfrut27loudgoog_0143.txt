(Lindi. Introd. to Bet„ p. 298.) This disenne shows iteelf by the extravannted
cambium forming long blnck streeke down the berk, end by ita sweetneee

Many kinds of insecta attack the elm. One of these, a npeciee of ffllticn

Em et Fau-eo, nnd in the Nouveau Du omel, it iu mentioned that galle,
or small bladders, are produced on the leaves of the elm, by the puncture of

nome kind of insect (probabi some of Cymiza), which are first green,
but afterwards turn bleck. ese ffizsch contem some drope of a liquid,

which is called, according to Du , elm balm, and wne formerly em-
pioyed for the cure of recent wounds. In the Nomou Com &Agr-imaum,
four insecta thet feed on the eim are mentioned. The first is the common
cnterpillar Bombyx chrysorrhoeh Fah„ which destroys the leaf buda and leaves
entirely, eo as to give the tree, in ring, the appearance of winter. The second
in the galeruque de l’orme (Galen- ca ulmeriensis Fah.), a coleopterous insect,
the larvae of which, in some wasone, entirely destroy the leaves of the eltn treet
in the public promenedes both in England and on the Continent. Mr. Spence
mentions that, visiting the boulevards at Rouen, in the summer of 1836, he
found the hrvae of this ineect had so completely destroyed the leaves of the
