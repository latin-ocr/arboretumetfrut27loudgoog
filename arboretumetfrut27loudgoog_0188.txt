Medic-bially, the use of the walnut is of the greatest antiqnity. Itis said to
have been one of the antidotes used by Mithridates. Pliny recommends it
“ for driving worms out of the stomach ;’' and adds that, ‘⁶ eaten aster onions,
they keep them from rising.'’ (Book xxiii. c. 18.) An extract of the uni-ipe
fruit is used b rustic ractitioners for the destruction of worms ε the fruit
itself is stomac ic ; an the bark, either green, or dried and powdered‚ is a
powerful emetic. The root is said to be pur tive and diuretic3 and a de- ,
coction of the wood, sudorific. The of t e leaves, mixed with milk, is
considered a remedy for horses having t e fistula. Evelyn tells ns that the
hnsks and leaves, being macerated in warni water, and that liquor poured on
grass walks and bowlin -greens, infallibly kills the worms, without endangering
the grass, Not, says {n Hnnter, that there is anything peculiarly noxious
in this decoction, but worms cannot bear the application of anything bitter to
their bodies3 which is the reason that δίκετε, such as gentian, are the best
destroyers of worms lodged in the bowels of animala. Worms are seldom
observed in the intestines of the human body, except in esses where the
bile is either weak or deficient. (Humer’s Evet„ . 178. note.) Philips states
that anglers water the ground with a decoction olpwalnut leaves, to cause the
worms to come to the sui-face of the ound, when they pick them up for
hait. The leaves, dried and mixed „iffi those of tobacco, are said to have
similar virtues to those of that plant. An extract of the unripe fruit, and
also a rob prepared from its Juice, are laxative3 and the vinegar in which
walnuts have been pickled is a very useful gargle.

Poetical and legenda-y Allusiom. The walnnt tree was dedicated to Diana,
and the festivals of that goddess were held beneatb its shade. The Greeks
and Romans, as before observed, strewed walnnts at their weddi
Horace, Virgil, Catullus, and many of the other Latin poets, allude to 't'ffi‘s
custom, which probably had reference to the bride's deserting the ranks of
Diana (to whom, as we have seen above, the walnut was dedicated.) for those
of Hymen (see p. 1426. ς and there is an allusion to it in Hertick’s Epitha-
lamium on Sir Thomas uthwell and his lady = -

British poets mention it for ifferent qualities. Cowley, however, has
