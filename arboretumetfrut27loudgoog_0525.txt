The difference between the two engravings of it was so great,
that we wrote to the Duke of Portland to ascertain the pre·

that Major Rooke’s pertrait still affor-ds a correct representa·

tion of it. “ In 1724, a roadway was cut through its vene- ” 16οι
rable trunk, higher than the entrance to westminster Abbey,
and sufficiently capacious to permit a carri and four horses to pass through
it.’' (Str-att’e Sylva.) The dimensione of t is trae are thus given by Major
Rooke2—“ circumference os the trunk above the arch, 35 ft. 3 in.; height of
the arch, 10 st: 3in.; width of the arch about the ,
middle, δὴ. 3in.; height to the to branch, 54ft.”

the tree as that in Hunter's Evelyn, which we have

cord' to Hunter’s Evdyn, about 1646 this oak was
88 ftlnhigh, with a trunk girting 3:³0st. lin.; the dia-
meter of the head 81 ft. “ There are three great arms
broken and gonefand eight very large ones yet remain-

The Parliament Oak (fig. 1610.) grows in Clip-

stone Park, and derives its name from a parliament
having been held under it, by Edward 1., in 1290. The girt of this tree is
28st. 6in. Clipstone Park is also the property of the Duke of portland, and
is supposed to be the oldest ark in England, having been a park before the
Conquest, and having been t en seized by ⁴

 

William, and made a royal demesne. Both
⁹ John and Edward 1. resided, and kept a
court, in Clipstone Palace. In Birchland,
in Sherwood Forest, there is sn old oak,
which measures, near the ground, 34 st. 4 in.
in circumference3 and at 6st., 31 st. 9in.
“ The trunk, which is wonderfully distorted,
plainly appears to have been much larger;

and the θρα-ιθ from which large ieces have
fallen ο are distin ‘ ble. he inside

is decayed and ho lowed by ageg and 1
think,'’ adds Major Roolre, “ no one can 1⁶¹0

behold this majestic tuin without pronouncing it to be of very remote an·

tiquityg and I might venture to say that it cannot be much less than 1000
years old.” (p. 14.)

In Worksop Park. according to the record quoted in Hunter's Ευεῐφι,
there were some noble trees about 1646. One of these, when cut down,

measured from 29 ft. to 30 ft. in circumference throughout the bole, which
was 10 ft. long. Another tree had a head 180 st. in diameter, and was com-
puted to cover ’halfan acre of ground. Other trees, 40 ft. in the bole, gave
2st. uate of timber at the upper end. The Lord's Oak girted 38ft. 4in.
The 'Sim-e- Oak, which is still standing, had then a head 90st. in diameter, which
gssgended into tgiree countles (York, Nottingham, and Derby), and dripped over
uare ar s.
