description of the flowers un er P. angulata is as fo lows =—“ Male flowers
polyandrous; female flowers rather distantly placed upon the rachim-glabrousg

noted. Martyn’s Miller, the male cathins are said to be like those of P.
nigra, and the anthera pu le. P. a lata, in North America, is, according
to Pursh, a tree about 80 . high3 its ranches are very brittle, and its leaves
are very large. It is wild in mor-asses on the banks of rivers between Virginia

and Florida, and on the Mississippi. Introduced into England in 1738, and
flowering in March.

frequently killed down several inches by the autumnal frosts. Aster the

when they first unfold, are smoot and brilliant, 7 ιη. to 8 in. long on young

renders the leaves easin “a-ted by the wind. “ The annual ,82¹0oe on

b prominent red lines in the bark, terminating at the insertion of the young
θ s oeta, which ultimately disappear with the rowth of the brancheS. This
character belongs also to the cotton-wood ( . canadensish but, besides the
difference of their neral ap ce, the two s ecies are distinguished by
th'eir buds: those o the Caro ina poplar (P. angu ta) are short, of a deep
green, and destitute of the resinous substance which covers those of the
cotton-wood (P. canadensis), and of which the vestiges remain till late in the
‘seasom The wood of P. angulata is white, soft, and considered of little use
in North America. As an ornamental tree, it forms a ver stately object}
