Isutmy. The black walnut seems to have been one of the first trees thet
were introduced from America into Europe; having been cultivated by Tradet-
cant, jun., about the middle of the seventeenth century. As it ripens its nutu
in this country and in France, it has been v general} introduced in artifici-l
plantations3 end it thrives as far north as weden, t ou it will not beer
fruit there. In Amen-ica, Jacquin informs us, it is much p anted near house·
for its shade, and also for its fruit3 being there, as here, considered herdier
than the common walnut.

Its most appro riate use, however, is for sumiture, which, when made from

of it. It is well adapted for nava] architectum, being more dul-able, though
more brittle, than the wood of the white oak3 and not liable, like that
wood‚ to be attached by sea worma in warin latitudes. On the river Wa-
besh, canoe- are made of it, some of them 40 st. long, and 2 st. or 3st. wide,
hollowed out ofa single trunk, which are greatly esteemed for their strength and
durability. The wood is frequently exported to Europe, in planks of 2 in. in
thickness, where it is used for cabinet pun-posen. As compared with the ποσά
os the Europeen weluut, which it more nearly resembles than it does any
other of the American ies, it is beavier, much stron r, susceptible of e
finer polish, and not ιο ’ le to be in‘ured by worms. ’ᾖξε husk of the fruit
is used, in Ameriae, for dyeing woollen stuffls yellow. In Europe, Micheux
thinks that this tree might be advantageously employed along high roadgto
succeed the elm3 for experience has proved, he observes, that, to inaure
success in the continued cultivation of either ligneous or herbaceous plante
in the sihmo soil, species of different natural orders must be made to succeed
one ano ier.

Propagafion and Uulture. In Eu end in America, the tree is uni·
versally raised from the nut, which, being imported, ought to be sown
immediately, es it seldom retains its vital ower more than six months aster
it has ripened. Nuts of Juglans regia an J. nigra have been planted at the
same time, and in the same soih and the latter have been obeerved to grow
more vigorously, and to attain a given height iu a shorter time, than the former
Michaux suffiests that, by ng the uropean upon the American walnut,
at the height of 8 st. or 10( ., their respective adven es in quality of wood
and fruit might be united: but we have not heard of t is having been done.
In Europe, as we have already observed, the black walnut is almost univer-
sally raised from the nut; and, if the nut is planted where the tree is finally
to remain, it will grow up with greater vigour, and not be retarded by that
