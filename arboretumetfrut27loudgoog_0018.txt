Introdueed in 1800, and flowering in July and August. This species,
when first introduced, was thought to be rather tender; but 1t is now
found to be almost as hard as Tecoma radicem, which it greatly re-
sembles, but is of a slighter abit, though it has much larger flowers, and
is altogether a very splendid plant. There is a fine specimen at Kew,1n
front of one of the stoves; a large one in the Horticultural Society's Garden,
which has stood ’nst the conservative wall there since 18253 and one

against the wall in t e Haokney arboretam. Price of planta, in the London
nurseries, 22. ed. each.
