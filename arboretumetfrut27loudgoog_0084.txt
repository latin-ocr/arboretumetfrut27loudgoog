for 1830, p. 148.) A shrub so common throughout Europe and Asin could
not escape being known to the Greeks end Romans ς but to what use they

apphed lt is uncertain. In modern times, its leaves form the food of sheep, in

r maritime pastures, where the sheep sometime· also ent the berries. In

pose as t et made from the berries of the Somnum Dulcemura, in Welesg

the see buckthorn are grateful y aeid, and ere much enten by the Tartara,
who make a jelly or preserve of them, end serve them up with milk or
cheese, as great dainties. The fishermen of the Gulf of Bothnie prepare n

rob, or jam, from them, which imparts α’ grateful flavour to fresh fiah3 and a.
kind of sauce is also made from them in the south os France. „In some

times p ted as hedges3 and, as it endures the sea breeze, and throws up suck-
ers freel from the roots, it is a useful plant for fixing drist sends, along with the
grasses saimma, E'lymus‚ Cerex, dec„ and also for producing woody scenery

fine effect of its berries in autumn; but it must be recollected that the ber-ries
will not be produced unless both sexes are planted contiguously. As the
flowers, especially those of the male plants, come out very early in the season,
their buds, which are in spikeS, have a conspicuous pearance during winter,
end contrast finely with the fruit on the female p ants, which remains on
through the winter, nster the leaves drop off, unless it is eaten by birds.
In British nurseries, plante are com-

monly increased by suckers, which

are produced in abundance3 and a

deep sandy soil is suitable for grow-

ing the plant to a large size. It may

be planted in elevated and exposed

situations and on the sea const, where

few other trees will grow.
