‘tilbert orchard, the defect can readily be su plied, when the female blossoms
(which are easil known b being sessile an solitary, or in small clusters, and
of a bright πει-ἵει colom?v ere emended, by collecting male blossoms from
wild trees, or any others where the een be spared, and suspending them on
the upper brunches of the tree. The Rev. G. Swayne has proved the utility
of this prectiee, both in his own ease, and in thet of some of his neighbohrs.

that the kind of pruni whic is found the beet for the current is also the
best for the filbert. Fiffierts intended for long keeping, this author observes,
“should remain on the tree till the ere tho hly ri ς which is easily
known by their rich brown colour. {hey should lai on a dry floor for ιι
few days, sud afterwards stored in jars of dry send, where the will keep

The eoleopterous insects are confined to the families Curculidnidae snd Chry-
somelidae. Amongst the former is especially to be noticed the Balaninus
nucum Ger-mar (Curculio nucum Lina), the larva of which is the white flesh

fine greyish brown, with deeper shades, and irregularly waved hands. The
semele beetle deposits its eggs in the nut whilst in a young and immature
state, the wound soon henling. This accounts for the larva being found within
the shell, without any hole being seen by which it might have entered. It
is said that the passage for the introduction of the egg is made by the female
drilling through the nnd with its rostrum. A single egg, of a brown colour, '
is introduced into ench nut, from which the grub is hatched in about a fort·
