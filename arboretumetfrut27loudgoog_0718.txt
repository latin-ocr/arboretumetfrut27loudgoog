coloured wood, found on soil, as superior in durability to that wi white
vood, which is only to be found on light soils. The grain of the wood is not
sufficiently homogeneous to receive 8 very high polish. The uses of the wood
of the beech, notwithstanding all its faults, are more extensive than those os
almost any other tree. The keels of vessels are osten made of itg and Mathevs,
