Spec. Char„ ᾶο. Leaves deltam, much acuminated, unequally serrated‚ quite

glabrous. (Willd. Sp. Pl„ iv. p. 463.) A tree, in every respect closely

a size as at species. A native of North Amerina.

Variett'es.

smooth, ’ ' ‚ deepl cut leaves, and appears to us to belong to
, Β. (a.) populi olla, rat er than to Β. alba.

Ξ Β. (α) p. 3 pendula, B. pendula Lodd. Cat„ ed. 1836, has the spray
droo ing, hke that of the weeping variety of the common birch; but
whether equally distinct or not, we have been unable to determine,
stom the very small size of the plants in the London collectione.

Descr'qition. The poplar-leaved birch, according to Pursh‚ is a tree from
30ft. to 40 ft. ' h3 but, according to Michaux,
it only attains t ‘ height in favourable soils
and situations. On trees that are fully grown,
the branches are numerous, alenda-,and droop-
ing. The leaves are smooth on both surfaceti,

beart-shaped at the base, very acuminate‚ and

' doubl and irregularly toothed. The petioles

on which this disposition is not observed. The
buds, a few da s after their developement‚ are
slightly coat with a ellowish odoriferous
substance, like those of . alba. The trunk of
this species is clothed in abark of as pure a
white as that of Β. papyracea and Β. alba3
but its epidermiS, when se arated from the
cellular integment, is c ab e os being divided‚
like that of Β. nigra an B. excelsa, into thiu
sheets, which constitutes an essential difference. --K ⁷
