the greater difficulty that is foundin propagatin it. The tree is wild in Lower
Canada, more particularly between Quebec and udson’s Bam and in various
places between lat. 47⁰ and 49⁰. Itis not v common about Montreal3 and
ns rare on the shores of Lake Cbam lain. Franklin‘s Fine J , it is
stated, that it is found as far north as e Great Slave Lake3 and that ken-
zie River has been named Riviere aux Liards, stom the abundance of the tree in
that quarter. It also constituted, C tain Franklin observes, ‘⁸ the greatest
of the drist timber that we observegpon the shores of the Arctic Sea. Its
name is Matheh·metoos, which means the ugly poplar.” (Fene J , δια,
. 753.) The balsam plm- was first brought from Canada to the Is and of
ersey, and pro there. Six of these plants were sent to Cardine,
consort to Georgo L, in the year 1731, under the name of arbre de la reine
One of these was given by the ueen to Sir Hans Sloane ς and, being planted
in the Botanic Garden at Ch sea,it soon produced male catkins3 but no
female or h hrodite oues, till about the ear 1760. This‘poplar was
introduced into cotland, according to Dr. alker, in 1768, having been
raised in a nursery-ground at Leith, in that year, stom seeds sent stom

In Sibenn, a medicated wme is prepared from the buda, which is daurenc, and
considered serviceable in the scurvy. Pallas states that the grouse, and
other birds of that family, that seed on the buds of this poplar during winter,
have their flesh imbued with a grateful balsamic flavour. In Europe, the only

lication of this tree is to ornamental purposes3 and though, when it grows
εἷς and scrubby, it may merit the Cree name of ‘⁴ ugly poplar,” yet, when
young, few trees can be compared with it in the begu„ of summer, either
