them in a day. It grows with equal rapidity, when young, as the J. nigra,
but the trunk ramilies at a less height3 and, the branches extending more hori-
zontall than those of most other trees, and spreading widely, a large and flat
tufted head is formed, which gives the tree, in America, more especiall in
exposed situations, a most remarkable appearance. In Britain, we ve
scarcely seen any old trees; and, never having observed any fruit on the
few of middle size which we have seen bearing this name, we have always
been in doubt as to the specific difference between them and J. nigra.

Geography. Jnglans cinerea is found in Upper and Lower Canada, and in
the temperate regions of the United states, but not in the lower parts of the
Carolinas, of Georgia, and of East Florida. It grows ‘ rousl in Vermont,
where the winter ts so rigorem, that sl es are used uring our months of
the year. Michaux has seen no trees o it so large as some in New Jersey,
on the steep and elevated banks of the Hudson, nearl opposite to the city os
New York. There the woods are thin, the soil col , unproductive, 8ηά in-
terspersed with large-rocks.. In the interstices of the latter, the-butter-nut

under the surface, and with little variation in point of thickness, to the dis-
tance of 40 st. from the tree.

Παίου-μ. J. cinerea appears to have been first sent to Europe in 1699, at
which period it was cultivated by the Duchess of Beanfort3 but whether in
her gai-den at Chelsea, or in that at Badminton, we are not aware. Itis
said to have been wn by Miller3 but, from his description of it, as having
only two pairs of eaflets, we think it more likely that the plant he describes
has been some other species under this name. At present, J. cinerea is not
unfrequent in British and French nurseries ; and nuts are annually importet!
by the seedsmen 3 but we know of v few large trees.

Proper-ties and Uret. The wood ἳῗᾶὺςωηε cinerea is light, of a reddish
colour, and of little strength3 bnt it possesses, in common with the wood of
all the ‘es of the era of this'order, the great advantage of lasting long,
and ofsggieiig secure rom the annoyance of worms. In Ameriea, it is never
used in towns for the construction of houses3 but in the country, in some
districts, it is used for slee rs and silla in the framework of barns and
other farm buildings. As it ong resista the effects of heat and moisture, it is
valued for posts and rails, and for waterinff and feeding·troughs for the use of
cattle. Belng lighter, and less liable to s it, than the wood of the red maple,

pain or usitation. The bark is also ap lied to cure the toothach, and to
dye wool of a dark brown colour3 thoug , for this last purpose, it is inferior
to the bmk of J. nigra. If an incision is made in the trunk of the tree, in the
month which precedes the unfolding of the leaves, a copious discharge of
slightly y sap takes place, stom which, by evaporation, an inferior
is obtain On the whole, notwithstanding the various properties of 5:5⁸
tree in the United States, Michaux does not think it sufficiently valuable,
either in the arts or for fuel, to recommend its introduction into the foresta
os Europe. It should, he says, find a place only in our pleneme-grounds.
