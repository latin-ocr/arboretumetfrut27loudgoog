wst„ with a trunk 12 in. or 15 in. in diameter3 found
b Micbaux on the books of the river Hndson, a little

ve 4lbany3 and by Pursh about Lake Ontario.
Ju‘hssinss from the planta in the collection of Messrs.
Lo digea, and Michaux’s figure, we have no doubt
whatever of its being, like Ρ. εεηιιάἑηείε, merely a variety
of P. nigra. It ie, however, tolerably distinct3 and, being
a small, neat, deep-green-leaved tree, well desei-ves a
place in collectione.

Spec. Char„ ‹3-0. Shoot more or less angular. Branch round. Petiole
alender, compreeoed in the upper part3 in some leaves, shorter than the
dish, in others longer. Disk deltoid, glanded at the base, which is aub-
cordate in some leaves, and very obtusely wedge-shaped in others ς tip
acute ς edge serrated all round, except in the central part of the base, and
at the acute tip, the teeth have incur-ved points; glemona, exc t in the
edge, which, at least when the leaf ia growing, is ciliate3 ed u timately,
and rhaps early, ‘etly. Male flowers about 30. in a in, upon e-
dmg-e Bractea roua. Stamene 16, a little longer than the coro la.
Female flowere about 40 in a catkin. Stigmas 4, dilated, jagged. (Pur-sla,
Wats„ Mac-hx„ ., and obe.) It ia rather doubtful to what country
this poplar is in igenous: Canada is ‘ven aa ita native country in the
Hortus Kewemis ‚· but, in the Nouveau gu Hamel, it is stated to be a native
of Vi ‘nia. Michaux,jun., etates that neither he nor his father ever found
it wil in Ameriam and Pursh adds that he has only seen it in that
country in gai-dena. According to the Hortus Kewensa'r, lt was introduced
into Britain by Dr. John Hope‚ in 1772. lt is a tree, according to Pursh,
stom 60 st. to '70 st. high in America ς but ·1n Britain it grows to the height
of 100 ft. or 120 st„ or upward83 flowering in March, and ripening its seeds
ώσω. the middle of May.
