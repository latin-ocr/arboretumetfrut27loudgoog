name of “ The British, lnsh, and Colonial Silk Company,” with a large capital,
8ηά under the direction of the celebrated Count Dandolo‚ whose treatise on

the management of the silkworm, δια, is considered the best work extant on
the subject in Italy. This company formed extensive plantatione in England and
lreland, particularly near Slough, and near Cork 3 8ηά Mr. John Heathcoat of
Tiverton, Devonshire‚ one of its most influential members, invented a method of
reeling which was attended with the most complete success. The company
also formed plantatione in Devonshire: but, aster numerous trials, it was found
that the climate of the British Isles was too humid for the production of useful
silkg and the company was finally broken up, and its plantatione destroyed,
in 1829. For further details respecting this company, and its operatione,
see Enyo. qs ‘ ., sd edit., . 1105. The cause of the entire failure of
this spirited un ertaking‚ as we as that of James L, will, we think, be found
in the following very Judicious observations fmm the Joumat &Agris-altare
desPayaBar ‚· which will show the impracticability of any future attempt to rear
silkworms as an article of commerce in Britain, or in any similar climate :—
“ The mulberry tree is found in different climates; but the juice of the leaves
grown in the north is much less suitable for the production of good silit, than
that of the leaves of the south. ln this respect, mulberry leaves and silk differ
as much as wines, according to the climate and soil in which they are pro-
duced. In general, every climate 8ηά soil that will grow wheat will

roduce large succulent mulberry leaves3 but these leaves wil , in man cases,

e too nutritive3 that is, they will have too much sap, and too much su ce
and succulenc . The wild mulberry, with small leaves, answers better, for such
a soil, than iiie grasted mulberry, with large leaves. Α general mle, and one
to be d ended on, is, that the mulberry‚ to produce the best silk, requires the
same soeiiJ and exposure that the vine does to roduce the best wine. Ex
rience has roved that silkworms noui-iahed hy leaves gethered from a ry
soil succ much better, produce more cocoons, and are less subject ω those
diseases which destroy them, than those which have been nourished by leaves
produced by an exn-eniel rich soil.” (See Gara. Mag„ vol. iv. p. 52.) The
silkworm was introduc into America by James 1. 3 who, at the same time
that he published his edict for the planting of the mulberry tree in England,
sent over mulberry trees and silkworms to Virginis, accompsnied by a book of
instructions for their culture, and exhortatione to the inhabitants to pursue it
instead of that of tobacco. The worms thus introduced were ⁶ y culti-
vated3 but, not being so lucrative as tobacco, rice, and indigo, t ey made but
small progress till the time of Dr. Franklin. That truly great man established
a silk manufactory at philadelphia, which was put a stop to by the war of
independence. Silk has still continued to be raised in some remote parts of
the country3 but it is only since about 1825 that any establishments have
been formed on a scale. lt is now produced extensively through all the
southern provinces o the United Statesg and it seems probable, from the hest
and drgness of the American summers, that it will equal the silk of Italy.
Since t e introduction of M. 8. multicaulis into America, which took place in
1831, an attempt has been made to obtain two οἵτε in one year, which, it is
said, is attended with ev prospect of success. he same may be observed
of the culture of silk in uth America, in which it has been commenced at
Rio Janeiro, the (lanceas, Buenos Ayres, and other laces.

In lndia, the culture of the mulberry 8ηά the sii‘kworm continues to be
practised ς but how far it will be promoted or retarded by the progress of this
culture in Euro e and America remains to be proved. It appears prohablc,
however, from e superior climate of Basterh Asia, that, when general com-
