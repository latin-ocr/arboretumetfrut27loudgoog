old.'' Half of them may then be cut down, one half of the remaining 1000 at
25 years old, and the remaining 500 at from 30<oe 35 years old. “ To plant
nurses, therefore, is attended with very great pecuniary advantage. It will
not only return the whole expense laid out in making the plantation, but pro-
duce a very high rent for the land during the first 30 or 35 years; whereas,
if oaks alone were planted, nothing could be gained during this period, ex-
ce t by cutting them down when between 20 and 25 years old, for the sake
o their bark.'’ (Prae-t. Plane„ p. 225.) The most valuable part of this writer’s
observatione is what relates to the nature of the benefit to be derived from
the nursee in such a climate as that of Abetdeenshire; which is, by reventing
the first ra of the sun from suddenly thawing the fresta-which gave fallen

change of temperatura, from the chilla os the night to the strong rays of the
morning sun. When the thaw takes place gradually, the injury done is eom-
ffiatively insignificant3” (gem.) “ If we wiab, then, to preserve σὼ stom

change o temperature ' be entirely prevented. It is not too much to say
that a plantation of oung oaks, thus sheltered from the outset, will make
more progress in 5, an unsheltered one will do in 10, years.” These
observatione ma be considered as principally applicable to cold districts,
whether from evation or latitude; but they are also judicioua' even with
reference to plantatione in the comparatively warm climate of the south of
Englaud, as is evident b the ractice of shel ⁶ with Scotch pines in the
plantatione made in the {lew orest, where the is indigenous, and where
the soil is particularly well adapted to it.

Cobbett would plant oaks in rows 25ft. apert, and 25st. apartin the row3
placing the planta of one row opposite the middle of the intervals between the
planta in the next row. Then, he says, ‘⁸ 1 would have four rows of hazel at

and where the interfered too much with the oaks, it might be cut away
with the hook. By the time that the hazel coppices were fit to cut for the first
time, the oaks would have attained a considerable height ς per s Θῆ. οι· lost..
This would give them the mastership of the haze13 and, after e second cut·
ting of the hazel, there would begin to be an oak wood, with a hazel coppiee
beneath3 and in the meanwhile the cop ice would have produced very nearly
aa much as it would have produced if t ere had been no oaks growi among
it. By the time that four cuttings of the haael would have taken p e, the ·
coppice would be completely subdued by the oake. It would produce no
