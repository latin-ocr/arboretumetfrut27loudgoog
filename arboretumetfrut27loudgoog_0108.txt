is now much in demand; and 8 list of their names will be found in Gardener’s
Magonine, vol. xi. p. 539. Castelet, in his Μέθω- les Miris-rs blancs,
which is generally considered the best work on the subject extant in
France, divides the varieties of M. slba, now cultivated in Provenee sor

propagated by grasting, and the former by cuttings, layers, or seeds.

Description, ᾆσ. The white mulberry is readily distinguished from the
black, even in winter, by its more numerous, slender, up ⁸ nt-growing, 8ηά
white-barked shoots. Itis 8 tree of much more rapid gro than M. nigra,
and its leaves are not onl less rough and more succulent, but they contain
more of the glutinous milly substance resembling caoutchouc, which gives
tenacity to the -lk produced by the worma fed on them. They are generally
cordate and enm-e, ut sometimes lobed, and always d ly serrated. The
fruit of M alba 8ηά its wild varieties is seldom good for uman food, but it
is found excellent for poultry3 and, sor this purpose, a tree of the species was
formerly erally lanted in the basse com· os the old French chateaux.

varieties, is not only eatable, but agreeable. The rate os grow of oung

in five or six years; and, when full grown, reaching to 30st. or 4oft. Its
duration is not so great as that of M. nigra.

Geograple . The whitemulberry is only found truly wild in China, in the
province οἶν Seres, or Serica 3 it is, however, apparently naturalised in many
parts of Asia Minor and Europe; and nearly al its varieties are of Euro
origin. It does not embrace so extensive 8 range of country as M. n gra,
being unable to resist either great cold or great heat. In 8 cultivated
state, it is found, as 8 read-side llard tree, in many parts of France, S ’ ,
Italy, and Germany as far nor· as Frankfort on the Oder. In Engffi,
it is not ff common ς 8ηά lt is scarcely to be found in Sootland, even
