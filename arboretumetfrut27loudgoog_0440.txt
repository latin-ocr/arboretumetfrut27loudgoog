The elder is planted to form hedges in meist meadowsg and it is planted
along the margins of rivers, to k up the bauks by its numerous creeping
roots. 1f the alder be planted in a ow meadow, it is said that the sut-face of
the ground surrouuding it will become boggy ; whereas, if ash be planted, the
roots of which also extend a great way in every directiou, and run near the
sul-face, the ground will become firm and dry; though on what fficiple these
changes take lace, we are not informed; aud the etatemeutis efore, most
probably, a vu ar error. The chief use of the alder ia as coppice-wood, to be cut
down ever five or six years,and made into charcoal sor the gunpowder manufac·
turers. Tyhe charcoal is considered the next best for that purpose to that of
Rhamnus Franguh, the berry-bearing alder, the aune noir of the French (see
p. 537.); and plantatione os the common elder are made by the proprietors of the

kinds of gunpowder, and t e spray sor the finer kinds.

As an ornamental tree, much cannot be said in favum of the elder. Du
Hamel remarks that its verdure is agreeable, and its shade dense3 and that
its leaves, like those on all plante which grow by water, remain ou longer in
the autumn than those of deciduous trem which prefer dry situations. In shel-
tened places, young aler trees frequently retain their leaves till January.
Du Hamel observes that, as cattle wi l never touch the leaves of the elder as
long as they cau get anythin else to eat, it is a good tree for parke, and
'also for hedges 3 aud he adds that it will form very good avenues in situations
ex sed to cattle. As an object for the laudseepe-painter, the leaves of the
al do not fall into fine masses3 and they appear too uniformly distributed
over the entire head of the tree. Nevertheless, as Gilpiu observes, it is a

in perfection, must follow the banks of the Mole, in Surrey, through the sweet
vales of Dor-king and Mickleham, into the groves of Esher. The Mole, indeed,
is far from being a beautiful river: it is a quiet and slufflish stream3 but
what beauty it has, it owes greatly to the alder, which every where st'mges its
mesdows, and, in many places, forms very Remu soenes, especially in the vale
between Box Hill and the high groun of orbury Par-k. Some of the

alders we bave iu England grow in the Bishop of Durharn’s ark, at
Bis p·Aucklend. The generaluty of trees acquire picturisque beauty y age ε
