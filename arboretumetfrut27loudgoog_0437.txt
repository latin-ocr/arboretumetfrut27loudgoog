able situations, is seldom seen higher than 40 ft. or 50 ἡ. 3
but in uncultivated grounds, and in good soil near water, ⁴
it will attain the height of 50 st. or 60 st„ and upwards.
This is not only the case with the ecies, but with the
variety A. ἱ. laciniata, which forms a andeome pyramidal
tree3 whic ‚ at Syon, has attained the he‘ ht of 63 ft„
and at Woburn Farm, near Chertsey, is still igher. The
bark of the common alder, in oldish trees, is nearly black,
and full of clestsz the colour of the wood is white before
the trec is eut down3 but, immediately on being cut, the
aurface of the wound becomes of a deep red3 soon fading,
however, into the pale flesh-colour, which the whole of
the wood of this tree, when cut down, takes when dry,‘and
retains ever afterwards. The wood is homogeneous‚ tender,
and without much tenacity. The branches, when they

and completely enclosed b two oblong
stipules of a whitish green. ey are from

in a favourable soil and situation, is about est. or Βῆ. a year for four or
five years ς so that a tree 10 years planted will frequently attain the height of
20st. or 25st.; and at 60 years the tree is supposed to have arrived at
maturity. The roots are creepingz and sometimes, but rare1y, they throw
up suckers. The shade and fallen leaves of this tree are not injurious

trees, being found in wet ewampy grounds, throughout the whole of

shrub. It is found in the west, (aunt,5 an north of Asia and in the north of
