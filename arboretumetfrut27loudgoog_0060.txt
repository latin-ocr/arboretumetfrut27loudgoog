‘⁸ The sassafras, on account of its medicinal properties, was one of the first
American trees which became known to Europeans. Monardez, in 1549, and
after him Clusius‚'’ trcat of its uses. Gerard calls it the ague tree, and sa s,
that a decoction of its bark will cure agnes, and many other diseases. he
bark is still emplo ed in medicine, that of the roots being preferred; and it is
said to be an exce lent sudorific. A decoction of the chi s is well known as
a remedy for scorbutic affections. In different parts of e United states, a
tea is made of the flowers, which ‘is considered very efficacious in purifying
the blood. In Louisiana the leaves are used to thicken pottage3 and in
vi ' ' a beer is made of the oung shoots. The sassafras chips which are
sol in the English druggists' s ops are formed of the wood of this tree3 but
what are called the sassafras nuts are the fruit of the Laurus Phcheri of the
Flora Pet-aviana. ( See Lincu. Notas ⁸⁶3⁹de Bigelow says that this trecis

and the spicy qualities of'its bark, render it a prominent object of notice, and
it seems to bave been one of the earliest trees of the North American con-
tinent to attract the attention of Europeans. Its character, as an article of
medicine, was at one time so high, that it commanded an extravagant price,
and treatises were written to celebrate its virtues. It still retains a place in
the best European pharmacopaeias.” ( Bigelow’s American Butrmy, vol. ii. μυί-1.)
He adds that “ the bark has an agreeable smell, 8ηά 8 fragrant spicy taste.
The flavour of the root is more owerful than that of the branches3 and both
flavour and odour reside in a vo tile oil, which is readily obtained from the
bark by distillation. The bark and pith of the young twigs abound with a
pure and delicate mucilage3 and in this muci and the volatile oil all the
medicinal virtues of the tree are contained. he bark and wood were for-
merly much celebrated in the cure os various complaints, particularly in
rheumatism and dropey3 but they are now only recogmsed as so ' a warm
stimulant and diaphoretic.'’ (Ibid.) The sassafras is of little ue as a
timber tree. ln Amen-ica, the wood, which is white or reddish‚ is sometimes
used for making bedsteads and other articles of firmitate, which are not liable
to be attacked by insects, and have a most agreeable odour, which they re-
tain as long as the are sheltercd from the sun and rain. The wood is of

Sm'l, Propagation‚ ᾅσ. Any free soil, rather moist than dry, will suit this
species, which is generally propagated from imported seeds, which should be
sown or put in a rot-heap‚ as soon as received, as they remain a year, and
sometimes two or three years, in the ground, before they come up. The sas·
safras may also be propagated by cuttings of the roots, or by suckers, which
