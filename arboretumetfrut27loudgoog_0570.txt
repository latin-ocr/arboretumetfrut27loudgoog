conductm power of the dense mass which composes the head’of ⁸ treet
for, though pines and firs grow higher, yet they are of lighter forms, and their
inferior conductibility, from the resinous nature of their wood, may in some
measure protect-them. Some very remarkable instances of oaks being struck
by lightnmg are recorded in the Philosophiae! Damae-tione by Sir John Clark,
who thus writes 2-“ Being lately in Cumberland, 1 there observed two curi-
osities in Winfield Park, belonging to -the Earl of Thanet. The first was a
huge oak, at least 60 st. high, and 4ft. in diameter, on which the last great
thunder had made a very odd impression3 for a piece was cut out of the tres,
about 3in. broad aud 2 m. thick, in a straight line from top to bottom3 and
the second was, that, m another tree of the same height, the thunder had cut
