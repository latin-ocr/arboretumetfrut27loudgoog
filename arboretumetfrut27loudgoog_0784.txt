The hazel, as a fruit tree, is most commonly propagated by snckers, more
especially in the neighbourhood of Maidstone‚ where the uuts are grown to
greater perfection than any where else in England. Plantationsare generally
made in autumn, in soil which has been well trenched and manured. The
plants are laced in rows, at from lost. to 20st. distance from each other,
and at 10 t. spart in the row3 while between the rows hops are frequently
grown for a few years ς but, after the filberts have attained a sufficient size to
nearly cover the ground, the hops are destroyed. Filberts are also frequently
planted in rows,1n the intervals between larger fruit trees, such aa apples,
cheri-ies, &c ; but, though they grow very well in such situations, yet,
m being shadai, and sometimes partially under the drip of the lar neec,
they seldom, if ever, bear so wellas rn plantatione by themselves. ἷξε prin-

often may be owing to the excessive productiveness of the years,
owing to the mode of pruning, by which the whole nourishment of the tree is
expended in the production of fruit;” and he recommends having the trees
rather more in a state of nature. (Hor-t. stans„ vol. iv. p. 154.)
