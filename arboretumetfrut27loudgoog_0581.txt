insecta, chiefly belo ng ιο the order Hernfptera of Linnaeus (Homoptera
Lata), and furnish with an elongated rostrum, which they introduce with·
out difficulty into the sost substance of the young parts, and thereby imbihe a
sufficient suppl of nourishment. Amongst these are to be mentioned, Psylla
quercus, Eriosgma quercus, Astphis quercus, and Astphis roboris. coccus
quercus Lm, is a ⁸ about the size os a pea, which attaches itself
to the branches at e base of the you stems. Another insect of the
same genus, of 8 species not yet determin is more injurious, as we leam
from a communication made by Μ. Victor Audouin to the Entornolo ‘cal
society os France, on the δώ of April last (1836), b whom a portion o the
berk os an oak, os about thirty years’ growth, was ex ibited, entirely covered
with specimens os a coccus about the sue os a pin’s head. These insects were
of 8 greenish or orange yellow colour, and were females, destitute of motion,
adherin to the tree by means os their rostrum, which had pierced the bark.
The οοὲ had been in a languishi state, and was condemned to be cut down
by the director of the Bois de ιἔσΙοςιιιε, having, as h1.V.Audouin judges,
been brought into this state by the resence os many mrlhons of these insecta
which covered the entire trunk (gom ein. above the ground to the top:
completely alter-ing the natural colour of the tree, aa from 50 to 100 might be
counted in the space of a uare inch.

The Accu-ns are devoured y the larvte of a small weevil belonging the genus
Balanlnus (B. glandium), and v nearly related ιο the nut weevil3 as well
as by the larva of Tinea Pomon (according to Geoffioy).

Galle. The various parts of the oak are also subject ιο the attacks of dif-
serent species of hymenopterous insects belonging to the Linnaean genus Cy-
..ffwwmwfflae -rszzyzcrgmz ..zzz-:azazae
and which are designed by nature to·protect the delicate ova and larv’ae ol*
certain insecta. Entomologists say that the tumours on the leaf stalks, and
those on the fruit stalks‚ are produced by different ies of Cynipidae3 that
the galls on the branch are produced 1,)ζέ distinct y from that which pro·
duces the gall on the leaf 3 and ιι has been ascertamed, that the gall flies
on the oak leaf are of at least three different kinds. There are also distinct
kinds of gall flies for the root, berk, bud, and acorn cup, independently os the
hermes and 1 nnt. The various ’es have been named, C. uercus folii

There is another circumstance, also, conn with this subject, of con-
siderable interest in a physiological point os view (inicipmdently of the man-
ner in which the gall, co nent n n the punctus-e an insect is formed),
and which is thus alluded to Dr. ohnston of Berwick =—“ We observe that
the irritation caused by the eposition and evolution os the egg will produce
growth os the most eurious kind3 and differences in the irritanon, too slight
ιο be traced, will occasion very remarkable differences in the appearance of
the growth. Thus, in the οὺ leaf, one insect irritation produces a globular
smootb ball; and another, a depressed tumour, covered with a hairy scarlet
coat. The first is seated on the substance of the leaf, and cannot be removed
without destroying the texture of the part; the other seems almost placed on
the leaf, and can be detached with facility. Examples equally remarkable
will occur ιο every one who has paid any attention to this cuncus subject3
and the growths appe-ag to be not less uniform, and not lm··organised, than

of Q. infectoria3 hut, like the galls of commerce, those Bnttsh galls are said to
be the best from which the insect has not escaped. The largest species os
British galls is generally called the oak apple, or oak sponge (Spongia ercina
of the ancients). These are produced by C. q· terminalis Fab. meum.
