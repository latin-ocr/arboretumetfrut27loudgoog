Fruit globose, roughish with minute prominent points, situated upon a
short inflexible peduncle. Nut globose, ,somewhat compressed at the
sideri, ridged and furrowed. (Mic-hx. North Anoer. Sylva, i. p. 153.) Α native
of fertile soil in woods in North America, from New Englund to Florida.
Introduced in 1656, and growing to the height of from 60 ft. to 100 ft.;
flowering in April or May, and ripening its fruit in October. ·

Description,‹5·c. The
black walnut, in the
United States is of-
ten seen from 60 st.
to 70 ft. in height,
with trunks of from
Βῆ. to 4ft. in diame-
ter3 and occasionallv
much hi her, with
trunks of rom 6 ft. to
vft. in diameter. Ac-
cording to Michaux,
when 1t stands insu-
lated, its branches ex-
tend themselves ho·
rizontally to a great
distance, and εἶναιεί
into a spacious ead,
which gives-the tree a
ggg.m÷l''h2nl3eaaege2sse about 18 in. in le h, composed of 6, 7, οι· 8 pairs
of opposite leaflets, wrth an odd one. T ey are acuminate, serrated, and
sornewhat downy ς and, when bruised, they emit a strong aromatic odour.
The male catkins are simple, pendulous, and cylindrica13 unlike those of
the hickories, which are always eompound. The fruit is round, odoriferous,
and of rather an unere-n surffice: lt is sometimes 7 in. or 8 in. in circum-
ference when fully {rovum and it always appears at the extremity of the
branches. The hus is thick, and is not, as in the hickories, divided into
sectionsz but, when ripe, it softens and gradually decays. The nut is
hard, somewhat compressed at the sides, and furrowed. The kernel is
divided by firm ligneous partitione. According to Michaux, it is of a sweet
and agreeable taste3 but Catesby says that it is very oily and rank3 and,
when fallen from the tree for some months, or gathered and laid by, ia
only eaten by irrels or Indians. The wood is osa dark colour, approach-
ing to black. ‘iixKenmcky' the nut is nearly as large as the European wal-
nut; but in Genessee, where the climate is colder, it is not above half the size.
Michaux says that the differences in the moulding of the fruit are so various,
as to induce Europeans to consider the variations, in this respect, as indica-

palace at Fulham, abundauce of fruit is produced every year3 and the nuts are
sent to table, but scarcely considered eatable. The growth of the tree is re-
markabl quick, more so than that of the European walnutz the leaves come
out, in gennsylvania, in the second week of May; and, in England, about the
beginning of June, before those of the common walnut. At 8 or 10 years of
age, J. nigra begins to bear, and age increases its fertility. No tree will grow
under its shade, and even grass is injured by it. In 40 years it will attain
the height of from 50 ft. to 60 st.

Geogmphy. This tree is found in all parts of the United States, as far
