(Bor-rer ἰιιωὲπς. ot. Suffl.) The late Mr- G. An erson, who disti shed
and named the species, discovered it near Carlisle, in 1809; and ound it
asterwards in Fifeshire and other counties of Scotland3 and by the Thamea,
near Windsor, Readin , διε. The female has been observed, also, near
Nuthurst, Sussex. ( d.) The following description is taken from that
given b ΜΓ. Forbes in Sal. Wob. :—‘ A bushy shrub or low tree; flowering
in Apri , and growing, in the willow garden at Woburn Abbey, to the height
of 12 st. or l st„ with shortish, green, fuscous branches, round, downy,and
somewhat of a rusty hue when young, especially towards autumn ς but of a
more pale yellow in an earlier state. Leaves from 2} in. to 3 in. long;
obovate-lanceolate, tapering towards the base, with rather long oblique
points ς flat, villous, and dark green above; densel silky, reticulated, and
greyish beneath3 lower leaves entire, scarcel lin. o ς upper ones finely
serrated towards the apex, or rather fizrnis ed with stant, minute, glan-
dular teeth, entire towards the base; the rusty hue also visible in the
older leaves. Catkins of the female from lin. to lssin. long, appearing
before the leaves.’' Mr. Forbes deems this a kind of sallowg and its
rounded tumid buds show an affinity to the sallows. ΜΓ. Borrer bas placed
it in the group Viminales, aad is of opinion that it comes nearest to S.
Smithidna: he adds, of the young leaves, that ‘⁸ the newly expanded leaves
of the male are beautifully tinged with brownish purple, which is nearly,
