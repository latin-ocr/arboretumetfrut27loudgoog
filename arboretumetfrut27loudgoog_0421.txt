round-headed trees has been illustrated by Mr. John Thompson‚ in the lirst
volume of the Gar-dener’s Magnete ‚- of which r the following is an abs-
tract, with some explanatory additions z—The mbardy poplar, considered
as a tall conical mass of foliage, becomes of great importance in scenery, when
, οοιηηιεωά with round-headed trees. Itis a known rule in the composition
of landscape, that all horizontal lines should be balanced and supported by
. perpendicular onesg and,‘hence, the bridgc in fig. 1521.. displaying a long and

conspicuous horizontal line, has its effect greatly lncreased by the poplars
planted on each side of it. Not only the lines of the bridge are balanced
and supported by the upright poplars, but lengthened and pleasin reflec-
‚tions from the water are produced3 which, breaking the horizonta leams
,of light, not only produce variety and richness, but, by increasing the ength
of the perpendicular lines formed by the poplars, confer a degree of sublimuy
,ου’ the picture: since it is allowed by all writers on the material sublime,
“ from Burke to Dugald Stewart, that gradually tapering objects of great height
create the emotion of sublimity. This is admirably illustrated at Blenheun,
where the poplar is an accompaniment to all the bridges, but more parti·
cularly to that viaduct, near Woodstock, where the water first enters the park:
this, seen from the neighbourhood of the great bridge, forms a landscape of
much beauty and purity. On the other hand, the planting of the island in the
lake at Blenheim is as much at variance with good taste as the planting at
the bridge is conformable to it. It is covered with tall poplars‚ formin a mass
which seems too big for its baem-and which, from its stiffand uprig t sonu,

have been, to have looked down from the br1d on an ι d varied with
small groups of well-selected, low, round-head trees l Lombardy poplars
may be advantageousl planted wherever there is a continuance of horizontal
lines ς’ but they shoulJ be so arranged as to form a part of those lines, and to
seem to grow out of them, rather than to break or oppose them in too abru t
a manner. In the case of a stable or other agricultural building, where t e
princi mass extends in length, rather than in height, it would be wrong to
lant mbardy poplars,‚or other tall fastigiate trees,‚immediately‚before the
‘ldin ς but they will have a good effect when placed at the sides, or behind

it, as ·s own in fig.1522. This poplar is very generally 'planted in front of
the suburban cottages and residences which are to be ound within a few
