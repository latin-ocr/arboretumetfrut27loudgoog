the cottage of Philemon, who was asterwards changed into an oak tree, they
were treated with the greatest kindness. Philemon was a poor old man, who
lived with his wife Baucis in Phrygia, in a miserable cottage, which Jupiter, to
reward his hospitality, changed into a magnificent temple, of which he made
the old couple priest and pnestess‚ granting them the only request they made
to him; viz. to be permitted to die together. Accordingly, when both were

rown·so old as to wish for death, Jove turned Baucis into 8 lime tree, 8ηά

hilemon into an oak3 the two trees entwining their branches, and sbading
for more than a century the m ifieent portal of the Phrygian temple. The
civic crown of the Romans was ormed of oak3 8ηά it was granted for eminent
civil services rendered to the state, the greatest of which was considered to be
the saving of the life of a Roman citizen. Scipio Africanus, however, when
this crown was offered to him for saving the life of his father at the battle of
Trebia, nobly refused it, on the ground that such an action carried with it its
own reward. Lucan alludes to this custotn in his Pharsalia.

Boughs of oak with acorns were carried in marriage ceremonies‚ as emblems
of fecundit . (Archoeol. Attio„ 167.) Sophocles, in the fragment of mimenni,
describes decate as crowned with oak leaves and serpente. Pliny relates of
the oaks on the shores of the Cauchian Sea, that, undermined by the waves.
and propelled by the winds, they bore off with them vast masses of earth on their
interwoven roots, and occasioned the greatest terror to the Romans, whose
fleets encountered these floating islandS. (H'ut. Nat„ xvi. l.) Of the Her-
cynian Forest he says, “ These enormous oaks, unaffected by s, and coeval
with the world, by a destiny almost immortal, exceed all won er. Omitting
other circumstances, that 'm' ht not gain belief, it is well known that hills are
raised u by the encounter o the jostling roots; or, where the earth may not
