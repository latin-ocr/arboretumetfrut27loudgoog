it is not known, at this moment, whether the largest and the oldest osss
of Britain belong chiefly to Q. pedunculata or to Q. sessiliflora. We shall
first notice the doubts which exist among botanists as to the species to
which the term Robur was applied by the ancients3 and theu proceed to
gest {fsffikpedmmffita and Q. sessiliflora conjointly, under the name of the

Q. Rebar. The word Robur, according to some, is taken from robus, the
obsolete form of nahem, τεὰς which, as Burnet observes, would seem a fit
name for the red-wooded oak. Festus Pompeius says (lib. i.), “ Materiam
quae plurimas venas rufi coloris habet robur dictam.” According to others,
Robur is a plied to the oak from robur, strength, in allusion to the quality
of the woodp3 and this we think 'the more probable derivation. Much doubt
has been entertained by botanists as to what species or variety the term
Robur was applied to by Pliny. That author says (lib. xvi. c. 8.) ε —·
“ Glans optima in uercss, atque grandissima, mox esculo ς nam roboris pai-vag
cerro tristis, horrida, echinato calice, seu castaneae θ’ that is, “ the largest and
best acorn is that of the QuercuS, next that of the E‘sculus; for that of the
Robur is small3 and then that of the Uerris, rough, and covered with a bristly
calyx, like the chestnut.’' From this assage Secondat arrives ¹at the follow·

of petiolated and subsessile leaves, of pedunculated and sessile acorns,

had been reviously known, became the specific names of Q. pedunculata and

brown, varying to amber3 while that of Q. Tuas-’n is much darker than either,
so much so that the French call it chene noir. Burnet‚ confounding the
wood of the Q. Taazin with that of Q. sessiliflora var. pubescens, says: —
“ The wood is of a deep reddish brown, very like that of old chestnut.
Hence 1 cannot but agree with Martyn, that this is the true RObur of
the ancients3 and, if the Linnaean varieties are to be elevated to the rank
of species, to this the appellation Robur undoubtedly belongs.'’ (Amoen.
Quen, fol. 3.) Burnet, finding that Pliny describes the quality of the wood
