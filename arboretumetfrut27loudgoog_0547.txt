lupines. In British parkgacorns form an importantpart of the winter food of

Acorns are given raw or boiled to poultry3 and it is said to be easy to accus-

tom horses, cattle, and sheep to eat them. Acorns, roasted and treated like '

coffee, are said to nebu-d a liquor which closel resembles that beverage; and
when aprouted acorns are treated like malt, ey afford a liquor from which a
very strong spirit may be distilled. According to Bosc, thus is practiaed in
vanous parts of the north of Europe. The leaves of both species, gathered

chief beautiea are connected with them. Thus, it is not the erect stately tree
that is always the most useful in ship-building3 but more often the crooked

the oak, like other trees, take a twisted form m the vinds. It generally pre-
serves its balance3 which is one of the grand 'etun-esque beauties of every
