Description, ‹5⁸⁶- The cork tree bears a general resemblance to the broad-
leaved kinds of Q. Ple13 of which species some authorsconsider it only a

one seems us 1 ι
made a species. '¹1t would appel}
to be rather more tender than the
ilex; since the severe winter of
1709 killed to the ground the

eater pm of the cork trees of

rovence and Languedoc; and the

’ frost of 1739-40‚ one of the original

trees in the Chelsea Botanic‘Gar-
den. Like the ilex, ‘it varies ex·
coedingly in the magnitude, form,
and margins of its leaves, and also
in the size of its fruit. The nut,
according to Bosc, is more sweet
than that of the ilex, and may be
eaten as human food in cases of
necessit . Swine, he says, are exc

ly greedy of these acorns, and get
rapidly on them, producing a firm an very savoury lard. The Spaniards
eat the acorns roasted, in the same manner as they do those of Q. gramfintia,
and as we do chestnuts. The outer bark, the gre

extraordinary developement of the cellular tissi

is found wild in dry hilly places in the south

France, in Italy, in great part of Spain, and in t

north of Africa. In Spain, according to Capti

S. E. Cook, it is most abundant in catalonia auu

valencia. The wood of the cork trec, which weighs 84- lb. per cubic foot, is
used for the same purposes as that of Q. I *lex; but it is never found of suffi-
cient size to be of much consequence. By sar the most important product,
however, which this trec yields, is ‘its outer bark. This, which is the cork of
