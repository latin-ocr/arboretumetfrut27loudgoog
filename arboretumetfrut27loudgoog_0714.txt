History. The beech was known to bo the Greeks and Romans ς though
some doubts have misen as to the names by which it was designsted b these
nations. By Theophrastus it was called Oxus, and b Dioscorides hegen.
Theophrastus also describes a tree under the name of Ῐζὴόςοες but he plsces

same ss that of Linnaeus, is s proved by Fee‚in his Florede Vir-gil. ‘⁴ lJlmy
lib. xvi. csp. 6.) says, ‘ Pagi glans, nuclei similis, triangula cute includitur!
The mast of the beech is like a unt, included in a mngulsr csse.) The
epithets applied to this tree by Virgil are au licable to our,- beech. · lt in
