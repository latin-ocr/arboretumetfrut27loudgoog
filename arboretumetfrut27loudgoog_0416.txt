1t comes into leaf, in the climate of London,
in tbe last week of A ril, or in the beginning
of May3 about whic time the male catkins
have chiefly dropped off. The cottony seed
is ripe about the middle of May, and is so
abundant, even in young trees, as to cover the
ground under them like a fall of snow. When
young, the tree shoots up with a strong erect
stem, which is much less liable to put· out
timber-like branches than any other poplar
whatever, except P. fastigiata and P. balsaf·
mifera. The rate of growth, in the climate of
London, on good soil, is between sost. and
«10st. in 7 yearsg and even in Scotland it has
attained the height of 70 ft. in 16 years. There

dens there, and neither Michaux nor his
ather had ever· seen it there at all, we think it probabl only a cultivated
variety of P. canadensis ; which, as we have before observ ‚ comes so near the
P. nigra of Britain, as to induce us to think that they are not specifically dis-
serent. P. monilifera was introduced into England iu 1772, from Canada3 but,
aa it is figured in Abbott and Smith’s Natural History of Georgia, vol. ii. t. 71„
it appears to be also a native of that country. Aster its first introduction, it
does not appear to have been much cultivated for some years, when it was
brought into notice by Messrs. Aschssmd Dickson and Co„ of Hasendeanbum
Nursery,under the name of the black Italian poplar. Its history under this name
is thus given in Pontey’s Profitable Planter .- — Messi-s. Dickson obtained the
plant from a gentleman in their neighbourhood, who had received it from his
son, then residing in North Amet-ica. Mr. Archibald Dickson then travelled
for the firm through most of the northern districts of England3 and, having
a hi h opinion of this poplar, of which he had been the first to procura a
stoc of plants‚ be recommended it every where. The name of the black
Italian poplar he accounted for to Mr. Pontey, by saying that he had learned
that this sort of poplar was common in Italy, as well aa in America- ΜΓ.
Pontey adds, in confirmation of ΜΓ. Dickson's statementz “ As 1 can now
recollect his having so recommended the article, and also having bought our
first stock from him, in ‘or-about tbe year 1787, Ι have, therefore, good reason

route, as they are much older than those to the south of it ς and, therefore, 1
think Messrs. Dickson entitled to the credit of having first recommended and
disseminated a trae, the rapid growth of which, in addition to its being highly
ornamental‚ will rove of essential benefit to the country.” (Pontey’e Profl
Planter, p. 218. This was written in 1813, when Mr. Pontey published
the. first edition of his book3 and the black Italian poplar has, since that
period, been far more extensively planted in Britain than any other species

lars, such as P. nigra, P. canadensis, P. betulaefbliaffl. fastigiata, and P. angu-
lata, to be different forms of one species) that P. monilltera may have been
originated in Italy or Switzerland, and carried out to North America; and, if
so, this will readily account for the English name of black Italian, the
American name, mentioned by Michaux and Browne, of Swiss poplar, and the
French name of Peuplier Suissa. We have heard of a plant of P. fastigiata,
which appears to be throwing out a side branch of P. monilifera3 but we are
ο not authorised at present to state any articulare respecting it. The female

catkins of the two kinds appear so mue -·alilte, as to leave no doubt in our
minda of their identity as species.
