abundant on the Apennines, especially at Valombrosa, and also between
Florence and Bologna , and we cannot help noticing a circumstance mentioned
by Sir T. D. Lauder, as having struck him when in Italy, and with which we
were ourselves very much pleased when there3 viz. that these chestnut treas
on the A nnines are generally scattered over a surface resembling the green-
sward o a British lawn. According to Dr. R. A. Philippi, Castanea vesca
does not appear to. be wild in an part of Etna, but always to be cultivated.
‘⁴ We noticed it,” he says, “ on e sides of Mount Zoccolaro, at a height of
3900st.; and Gemmellaro is said to have traced it as high aa 5100st.; but
this is probably a mistake, atisin from an erroneous calculation of the altitude.
On the south side of the Alps, t e chestnut trees reach to 2500 ft„ and on the
Pyrenees to 2800 ft. Etna is celebrated for the great age and colossal dimen-
sions of its chestnut trees: the noted Castagno di Cento Cavalli has a cir-
cumference near the root of 180 st.; the Castagno di Santa Agata, 70 st.; and
the Castagno della Nave, 64- ft. Their stema, however, attain no great height,
but soon branch off above the ground ; and, in regard to the first-mentioned
one, it seems probable to me that not one stem, but many, shoot from the
same root3 sor there are now 5 individual trunks separate from each other;
and it is a general custom in Sicily, when these trees attain a diameter of about
lft„ to cut them down just above the root, when a number of new shoots
are thrown out, which shortly become trees again. M. Brunner is of the
same opinion, as is stated in his Emer-sion through the East qf Ligna-ia, Elbo,
Sicily, and Malta.” (See Co . to Boe. Mag„ vol. i. p. 90.) In orth Ame-
rica, the sweet choetnut is ound as far as lat. 440 N„ in New Hampshire;
where, however, it is less common than in Connecticut, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania. It is most abundant in the mountainous districts of the Caro-
linas and of Georgia, and abounds on the cumberland Mountains, and in East
Tennessee; preferring, in all these countries, the sides of mountains, or the
fertile gravell soils in their immediate vicinity.

His-lory. he sweet chestnut is generally said to have been bro ht to
Europe by the Greeks, from Sardis, m Asia Minor, about 504 n. e. t was
first called, in Greek, Sardianos Balanos, the Sardis nut3 asterwards Dios
· Balanos Lopimon, from its being considered to bear some resemblance to the
walnut, except in the smoothness of its inner bark. The name of Castanea was

the chestnut grew in great abundance, being a native of the former locality,
and having been first planted in Greece in the latter, whence it was sent,
in the re' n of Tiberius Caesar, to Rome. It is evident that the Romans
received e chestnut from the Greeks, as they called it both Castanea and
Glans Sardisna‘. Theophrastus mentions that, in his time, Mount Ol pus
was nearly covered with chestnut trees3 and Plin enumeratas eight kin that
were known to the Romans in his da . Pliny adds that chestnuts were ground
into meal, and made into bread, by poor. These were osan inferior kind,
to which he gives the name of populares ς and he adds that there was another
sort, which were erally botled, and which were called coctivae. He like-
wise sa —“ Un er the common name of nuts, we eomprehend, also, chest-
nuts, ough they psa-take rather of the nature of acorns; except that they
have a lai-ger and more prickly cove “ . It is surpnsmg that we set so little
velue upon a fruit which nature hasnffiep so much penna. to preserve from

like the skin of the walnut= therefore care should be taken to remove it.
Chestnuts are better roasted than oooked in any other manner.” (Nat. H'ut.)
One of the largest and oldest chestnut trees in the world is that on Mount
Eme, above mentioned, and which is called Oas o di Cento Cavalli,
because, as it is said, Jean os Arragon, on her road rom Spain to Napleffi
visited Mount Etna, attended by her principal nobility, and was caught in a
heavy shower3 when the queen, and a hundred cavahers, took shelter under

the branches of this trec, which ecgmlplgtely covered them, and saved them
