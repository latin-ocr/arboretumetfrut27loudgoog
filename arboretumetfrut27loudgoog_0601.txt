of London, three weeks later than those of the<

common oak), are of a reddish tinge. The trecis

every part of the west, aa far as nanta, almost

always on poor sandy soil. In the Laudes, it is

known under the name of chene noir, teuzin, or

muza. At Augei-s, and at Nautes, it is called

a great distance, here and there throwing up suckers. The wood is of great
hardnees, toughuess, and durability3 and it is chiefly used for the construction
of wine coeka. Boec adds that the wood weighs 60 lb. per cubic foot,
