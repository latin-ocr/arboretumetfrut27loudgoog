This section consiste entirely of subvarietiea of the Lucombe oak,
which differ from the parent in being nearly evergreen; and respecting
which the following observatione have been ohhgin ly sent ω us hy
Mr. Pince 2-—“ These subvarietiee were all raised hy epi-esent Mr. Lu-
combe, from acorns gathered from the old Lucombe oak, about 45 years
ago (1792). Of the first three of these, there are l e specimens in the
Exeter Nun-serm being the original trees selected by r. Lucornbe‚ and
from which the planta exposed for sale are propagated. These fine
trees,” Mr. Pince continueS, “ which are the admiration of all who visit
the Exeter Numen-y, differ in many very material respecta from their

ent, but in nothing so much as being ever een. There is a peculiarit
nn these trees, however, as ev ns} whic deserves to be noticed. t
is, that in *the mouth of May, w en the young leaves burst forth, the old
ones, which are still quite stesh and green, are entirely and simul-
taneously cast offi so that the tree appears bereg hut so rapid ia
the change, that a few days suffice to clothe it afresh in full verdure.
Therefore, although these varieties are, to a great extent, decidedly
even-green, they cannot strictly come under that denomination. The

bark is very corky, and the Ιεὲινεε are of a gloesy blackish green
