female plant is the more desirable kind for the object of the cultivator. There
can be no doubt that the female of every species is the more vigorous—growing
plant3 and, consequently, where timber or coppice-wood, hoops‚ or rods for
the larger kinds of basketwork, are the produce wanted, the female of the
species to be cultivated ought to be preferred, however difficult it may be,

finer-growing species, but the males olithese species, ought to be select . It
ought also to be borne in mind, as a general principle, that willowS, to be of
any use, either as basket-rods‚ hoops‚ poles, or timber trees, must annually

account of the necessity· of perfectly ripening the wood. In regard to gene-
ral man ent, few ligneous planta require so little care as the willow, when
cultivat as timber or coppice-wood3 but considerable care is requisite
where it is grown for hoops or rods for wickerwork.

massas for the production of timber, are best formed in low moist bottoms,
