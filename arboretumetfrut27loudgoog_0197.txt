rounded at the base, serrate with shallow teeth3 tomentose benenth3 laten-al
ones sessile. Fruit oblonngate, with 8 tepered tip, downy, covered with
viscid mutter in small isansparent ‘⁸ vesicles” [P glanded hairsJ, pendulous
on 8 flexible peduncle. Nut oval, with an scammate ti , very rough with
minent irregular ridges. (Mida. N. Amer. S 1., 8ηά ΙΡυν-εή.) Α native of
orth America, near the sea const, from Can 8 ιο Virginis, 8ηά on the

in October. Introduced in 1656.

Desa-ipsine, 6-8. The grey walnut, according to Michsux, is 8 tall tree, like
Juglnns aigi-23 of which, notwithstanding the very different form of the fruit,
xi} munogegel thithking it is only 8 variety ς because it is not very reedily

' by the wood or
z leaves. We spesk,
however, only from ι
what we have seen in ι
young trees in the
neighbourhood of Lon- ε
dont 8ηά thisseems to
be the case with young
trees in American for
Hiehnux observes thet
the two species, when
young, resemble each
other in their foliage,
and in the rspidity of
their growth 3 but that
they are distinguishuble
ut fmt sight, when ar-
rived at maturity. The

the leaves ld 8 lbrtnight earlier then those of the enus Chrys, or hickories.
The leaves are composed of seven or eight pairs οἷ sessile leuflets‚ with 88
odd one. The lenflets are from 2 in. to 3 in m. length, serrated, 8ηά slightly
downy. The male cetkins are large. 8ηά cylindrical, 4in. or 5in. long, 8ηά
attached to the shoots of the preceding year; differing, in this respect, from
the male cetkins of the Juglsns nigra, which appear st the extremity os the
branches of the current year. The fertile flowers come out on the extremity
of the current yenr's shoots, 8ηά their ⁹ eta are rose-coloured. The fruit
is commonly single, 8ηά suspended by 8 iu plinble peduncle, about 3in. in
length: its form is oblong-oval‚ without any appearance of seam· lt is osten
2 in. in length, 8ηά 5in. in circumferenoe3 8ηά is covered with 8 viscid
hesive substance, composed of small transpurent vesicles, which are not
rendily discovered without the aid of 8 glans. The nuts are hard, oblong,
ronnded 8ι the base, 8ηά terminated at the summit in an acute point3 the
sun-face is ve rongh‚ 8ηά deeply and irregularly furrowed. In America, in
the neighbmssood of New York, the nuts are τι about the middle of Sep-
tember, 8 sortnight earlier than those of the ο er species of walnut. The
kemel is thick 8ηά oily, 8ηά soon becomes rancid3 hence, doubssess, the
names of butter-nut 8ηά oil-nut. In Ameria, the tree produces the fruit in

such abundance, that in some seasons 8 person may gether several bushels of
