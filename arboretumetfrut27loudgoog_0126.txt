Its wood, which is extremely lig t and tender, is used, in France, for making
whetstones, from its facility in receiving and retaining the emery and the
oil that are employed to shar n smiths' tooIS. The soft wood is white, and
the beart-wood yellow. It oses a great deal in weight hy drying; hut it
acquires by that process so much strength and elssticity, that the screws of
wine-presses are made of it. When used as fuel, it does not give a very
intense heat3 but its charcoal has the valuable property of consuming very
slowly. The fruit is esteemed demulcent and laxative3 and it has been long
used m domestic medicine as a poultice. King Hezekiah's boil was cured by
a lump or poultice of figs, applied according to the directions of Isaiah, and
which, Pro essor Burnet observes, is the first poultice that we read ofin history.
In the (lanaria, in Portugal, and in the Greek Archipelffio, a kind of brandy
is distilled from fermented figs. The leaves and bark os e fig tree abound in
a milky acrid juice, which may be used as renuet, sor raising blisters, and for
destroying warts. This milky juice containing caoutchouc,1ndian rubber might
consequently be made from the common fig tree in England,if1't were thought
desirable3 and, on account os the same property, the very tenderest of the
young leaves, might be given to the larva of the silkmoth. Au the speeies

.hut the fact seems undouhoed. As a fruit tree, the fig is valuable for thriving
and ripening fruit in situations not favourable in regard to light, air, or soil ς
-such as against walls in court-yards, against the walls of houses in crowded
cities, on the back-walls of green-houses and forci -houses, compfflvely in

In some cases, the trees are trained to single stems; and this is generally the
case in Italy and Greece, where the climate is milder, and the tree attams a
