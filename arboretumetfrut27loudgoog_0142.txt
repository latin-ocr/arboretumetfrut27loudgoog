this, itis proved by the practice in Βεῌυπι, is only an imaginary evil, pao·
vided the superfluous shoots are removed from the 11 exoeemity of ibe
decapitsted tree the second year, and the head forme with 00818108 care
by future pruning& (See the very instructive article by Poioem, already re- ·
fei-red to, in the Annales, and also the account of the Belgian actice, in
the Gardener’s Magasine, vol. x. p. 8.) In Britain, young clm trees, aving been
two or three times transplanted in the nun-series, 'ere placed in their final
situations without heading down; and in our moist climate they grow vi-
gorously the first year, and nire very little pruning. On the Continent,
owing to the greater warmthrg? the summer-s, and the consequent incressed
evaporat-ion from the leaves, plante are liable to be killed when wens-
planted with all their branches on3 and, hence, the mode of denuding the
plants just described is that generally practised. In Franee and Belgium, the
narrow-leaved elm is the most common tree planted by road sides, and along
the boulevards and streete of towns and cities3 and, in such casoe, a large pit
is previously dug, 4- ft. or 5 a. in diameter, 8ηά stom 2 st. to 8 ft. in depth ς and 8
considerable rtion of rich fine mould is placed in immediate contact with
the roots of tlig trees, and the pit filled up with the best part of the 80111111ιὶ011

supplied3 and the trees, or rather stumpa, grow freely3 very little attention ts

form. ln the neighbourhood of Paria, and 18 the south of France, U. eam-
pestris, and several of its varieties, occasionally hear seedsg and these are
sometimes sown by the nurserymen, in order to procare, new sorts; and by
the managers of the national foreste, in order to obtain numerous planta at 8
cheap rate. The common English elm very rarely produces seeds in England3
nevertheless it has done so in 8 few places, and one os thoee is Lea Park,
near Littlebourne‚ about four miles from Canterbury. Mr. Masters of Cen-
terbury 1188 only known seeds twice ripened in this ark3 and one os the
times they did not germinate. From those which ’d he obtained U. c.
viminalis, and nearly 8 score other very distinct variedes, which, however,
. stom the number of varieties already existing, 8ηά the little demand for them,
he did not consider worth keeping separate, and giving names to. U. 0.
stricta, and some other varieties of the common elm, as well as the species,
flower very profusely every year, but scarcely ever ⁸ seeds.

It is observed by Bosc, that the more remarkab e varieties, such as the
twisted 0181, the broad-leaved elm, the lime-tree-leaved elm‚ ἅμ, come
tolerably true from seed, s eaking of the mass of young plants; hut that among
these are constantly uced numerous subverieties. The seeds fall from
the trees as soon as t e are ripc3 and, being swept up, are sown immediately
in beds of light rich soi ς the seeds bei placed about l in. spart every way,
and covered to the depth of about an εἰιέῗιώ of an inch. The planta come
up the same season,and are fit for transplanting into nursery lines in the au·
tumn. Of all the European timber trees, not belonging to the coniferous family,
except the Lombardy poplars, the narrow-leaved elm requires the least care or

of lost. or 12 ft„ it is very prolific of branches, as a polhrd, and will live
and be productive, in this state, for. 8 great number of years. When
grown exclusively for the timber of its trunk‚ however, it requires to be
allowed a considerable amplitude of head3 perhaps not less than one third of
its whole height. The timber, in this case, is found to be far more compeet
and dui-able, though not so curiously veined aad variously coloured, as it is
when the tree is allowed to produce branches from the ground u ards. The
timber of the elm, not being remarkable for its durabilitffe in olzlwtrees, very
