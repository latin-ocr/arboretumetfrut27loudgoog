to the height of 3500 st. on some of the Η· bland mountains. According to
Dr. Wslker, the birch grows higher on the Highland mountains than sny
other trec except the mountain ssh: but in this he must have been' mis-
tsken3 because the extreme height at which the mountain ssh is found in
Forfarshire is, according to Wstson, 2500 ft.; and the birch is found, in various
pisces, 1000 st. higher up the mountains. Some of the finest specimens of
the wee ⁶ birch grow on the bsnks of rocky streems in North Wales. ln
Englsn ‚ e birch is supposed to hsve been once so plentiful in Berkshire as
to have given the name to that county; though some suppose the neure Berk-

Hirtam. The common birch was known to the Greeks (see p. 18.) and to
the Romans. According to Pliny and Plutarch, the celebrated books which
Numa Pompilius com 700 years before Christ, snd which were buried
with him on Mount aniculam, were written on the berk of the birch tree.
In the early days of Rome, the lictors had their fasces made of birch branches,
which they carried before the magistrates to clear the way, beating the people
back with the boughs. Pliny ssys that the birch was brought to Italy from
(ἰωῆς though, considering that it is s native of the Apennines, it is surprising
thet it should not hsve been known to the Romans ss an indigenous trec.

· The birch was formerly used in England for ornamenting the houses during

Rogation Week, in the same manner ss holly is st Christmss. Gerard says
the branches of the birch ‘⁴ serve well to the d ⁹ up of houses and ban-
quetting roomes for places of plessure, and besutifyin e streetes in the Crosse,

this sesson, ss he “ rid through little Brickhill, in Buckin amshire, every
sign poste in the towne was bedecked with green birch.” e have observed
the same custom in Poland, at the same sessos 3 where, also, lsi-geboughs are
fixed in the ground, against each side of the doors of the houses. The birch
has been used ss an instrument ofcorrection st schools from the earliest ages
Anciently, says Evelyn‚ “ birch cudgels were used by the lictors, as now the
gentler rods by our tyrannical pedagogues, for lighter ssults.'’ The sight of s
birch tree, observes the writer of the article Birch in the Nouveau Du Hamel,
“ offers s vast subject of interesting meditation: but happy the man to whom
its flexible pendent branches do not recall to mind that they were formerly
instrumehts of punishment to him l’' Gerard observes that, in his time,
“ schoolmasters sud ts do terrify their children with rods made of birch.”
The use of these r s, however, both in schools and private families, is now
fast passing away, together with many other barbarous practices of our an-
cestors. At present, the tree is planted in Britain in poor soils, and in exposed
situations, for sheltering others3 in oopses, for producing brooms‚ and for msn y
other valusble purposes; and, in favoursble soils and tntuations, as being or-
mental. On the Continent, and more especially in Frsnce and Germany, it
is extensively lanted ss a fuel tree, on the poorest soils ς snd, in good soils,
ss s nurse for d-wooded snd resinous trees. In the north of Russis, an
in Sweden and Norwsy, the natural woods of birch form the principal supplies
of fuel for large towns3 and, in many places, also the principsl timber for
buildings, sumiture, and rural implements.

” ⁸ aud Περ. Naturslly, the birch forms the food of various insects,
when in lesi'3 and the buds and cstkinS, in the winter sesson, are esten by nu·
merous birds. The siskin, or aberdevine (Fringssls inus L.), feeds upon the
seeds, which are its favourite food. The tree, when ol , forms the habitat of vs-
rious lichens, mosses, sud fungi ς particularly Daedsles bethum, and the fungus
(Polyporus fomentis-ius) that produces the moxs. The leaves snd young shoots
are also occasionally eaten by cattle, sheep, and swine, though they are not fond
