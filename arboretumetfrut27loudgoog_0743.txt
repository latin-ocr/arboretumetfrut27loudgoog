the British oak3 and it differs essentially from that tree, in its timber not in-
creasing in value as it increases in age. The trunk, in dee free soils, and in
situations sheltered rather than exposed, rises erect, an forms a massive
column of wood3 but, in unsuitable soils, and in elevated exposed situations,
and in cold climates, it ramifies at the height of lost. or 12 ft„ and the tree
assumes the character of a large pollard. In all cases, the diameter of the
trualt is ve large, in proportion to the diameter of the head, or the height of
the tree. ᾖε branches form nearly the same angle with the trunk as those
of the οὺς tho h in thriving trees the le is somewhat more acute. They
spread widely, anuff are round, and smooth w en young. The bark is remarkable
for its deep wide clests, which, Sir J. E. Smith says, “ seem to have furnished
ideas for some ornaments in Gothic architecture ;'’ alluding, we su pose, to
some kinds of tracery in the upper parts of windows in the florid Got c style.
The leaves on old trees are from 4 ui. to 6 in. long3 but on young and vigo·
rous shoots they are often nearly lst. in length, and from 3in. to 4in. in
breadth. In France‚ the leaves of the chataigniers are narrower than those
of the marroniers, and those os both are narrower than the leaves of wild
and cultivated chestnuts in England3 which difference may be observed in
the two climates to be the case more or less with all broad-leaved trees.
The leaves are elliptic-lanceolate, acute, smooth, with many transverse veina,
terminatin in sharp serratures ς often, but not always, terminating in
macros. ey are of a rich shining green above3 and paler, and sorne-
times rather glaucous, beneath. The barren catkins are numerous, axillary,
solitary, yellow, and pendulous; almost as long as the leaves, and decidu-
ous. The flowers are produced on the wood of the current year, and are
ranged along the common stalk, in lateral sessile tufts. The stamens are
numerous and spreading. The fertile flowers are much fewer than the barren
ones: they are placed on termina! stalks, which are lengthened out as the
fruit advances. The styles are about 6, with long, smooth, upright stigmas.
Gaertner detected about 12 scarlet rudimenta of stamens among ,the wool at
the base of the styles. Nuts large, broadly ovate, generally 2 ς flat on the
inner side, and each attached by a broad scar to the bottom of the eatly
enlarged outer calyx, the outside of which is copiously armed with comp icated
clusters of sharp grickles. (Smith.) The root descends perpendicularly, like
that of the oak, ut not, as it is alleged, to quite so great a depth. The rate
of growth of young trees, in the neighbourhood os London, averages from 2 ft.
to 3ft. a year for the first 10 or 12 years, The tree will attain the height of
from 60 st. to 80 ft. in from 50 to 60 ears3 before which period its timber is
generally in the ffifihaet degree of perAEctiom but the tree will live for several
centuries afterwar s, and produce abundance of fruit; its timber, in the mean
while, beginning to decay at the hear-t, or become brittle, and fit only for fuel.
In Germany, according to Willdenow, the height is from 20 ft. to 30 ft.. and
the duration of the tree from 50 to 100 years. In America, according to
Michaux, the chestnut, in favourable situations, commonl attains the height
of 70 ft. or 80 ft„ with a circumference of 15 ft. or 16 st. he oldest chestnut

nut, at,whatever age it maybe cut over.
