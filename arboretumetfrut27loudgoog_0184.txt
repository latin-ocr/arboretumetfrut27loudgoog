Greeks afterwards called the walnut tree Ca on, on account of the heavinees
of the head produced b its strong smell. en the walnut was introduced
into Europe is altoget er uncertain3 but it was cultivated by the Romans
before the death of the Emperor Tiberius, and is sup osed to have been
brought from Greece by Vitellius. Strabo informs us t at in Rome, at one
time, tables of the wood sold at a higher price than those of citron. Ovid
wrote a little poem, entitled De Nuce, by which it appears that then, as now,
walnuts were knocked down from the trees by boys3 and that, at marriages‚
walnuts were thrown by the bride and bridegroom among the children
who surrounded them3 a ceremony which was instituted to show that
the bridegroom had lest off his boyish amusements3 or, perhaps, to signify
that the bride was no longer a votary of Diana. (See p. 1430.) Hence, pro·
bably, is derived the French word for nn tiele, der nocer. In France, at the
festival of the Rosiere at Salency, in the epartment of the Oise (see p. 792),
in the sixth century, it is directed that an offering be presented to the
young maid who is crowned, composed of walnuts and other fruita of the
country. The walnut tree is now to be met with in every art of Europe,
as far north as Warsaw3 but it is nowhere so sar naturalis as to produce
itself spontaneously from seeds. In Britain, it has been in cultivation from
the earliest period of botanical history, and, in all probability, since the
time of the Romans. It ripens its fruit in fine seasons‚ in the neigh-
bourhood of Edinburgh, as a standard; and it lives against a wall as far
north as Dunrobin Castle, in Sutherlandshire. It is much cultivated, in some
arts of Italy, France, Germany, and Switzerland, as a road-side tree.
{lichnux saoys that it is more abundant in those parts of France which lie
between 45 and 480, than in any other part of Europe3 and that the fruit,
the oil, and the wood may be considered as forming, in that ’on, some of
the rincipal brancbes of commerce. This corresponds with Ἔα is stated
by velyn. “ Burgundy,” says that author, “abounds with walnut trees,
where they stand in the midst of ΐοάΙζ wheat lands, at sixty and a hundred
feet distance; and so far are they ⁸orn urting the crop, that they are looked

betwixt Hanau an Frankfort, in ermany, no you farmer whatsoever is
permitted to marry a wife, till he bring proof that e is a father of such a
stated number of walnut trees, and the aw is inviolably observed to this

p At differenlt, period& there has been a great dearth of the wood of this tree in
France, where, as in England, in time of war, it was much in demand sor
gun-stocks. Itis a remarkable fact in the history of this trae, that, in the
winter of 1709, the greater part of the walnut trees of Europe, and more
especially of Switzerland, France, and Germany, were killed; or so far in-
jured, as to render it advisable to fell the trees. The Dutch, at that time,
soreseeing the scarcity of walnut timber that was likely to ensue, bought up
all the trees that they could procare, in ever direction, and sold them again,
accordi to the demand, for many years agei-warda, at a greatly advanced
price. Ἦ] the year 1720, an act was assed, in France, to prevent the ex-
portation of walnnt timber, on ain opconfiseation, and payment of a fine of
3,0001ivres. A great many nut trees were, at that time, planted in the
royal demesnes. In 1806, the manufacture of muskets required about mooe
trees yearly. In consequence of this, a great many plantatione were made by
individuals3 and a prize was given for the cultivation of the tree by tbe
Society for the Encouragement of Arta, in Paris, We bave been informed
by M. Michaux, in a letter dated December, 1834, that in 1818 be formed a
