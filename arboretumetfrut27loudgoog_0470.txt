'nearly a uniform diameter, straight, and destitute

of branches for soft. or wst. It is particularly
remarkable for the colour and arrangement of its
epidermis, which is of a brilliant golden yellow,

and frequently divides itself into very fine strips,

rolled backwards at the ends, and attached in the

middle. The young shoots and leaves, at their un-

foldin are downy. Towards the end of summer,

when ully expanded, the leaves are perfectly smooth‚

young shoots‚ have all an agreeable taste and smell,

similar to those of the black birch (B. lenta),

though they lose it in drying. In its fructification,

this species nearly resembles B. lenta. The female

catkins are borne on short peduncles, and are twelve

scales are the small-winged seeds, which are ripe, in America, about the lst
of October. (N. Amer. Syl„ ii. p. 104.) It abounds in the foresta of Nova
Sootia, of New Brunswick, and of the district

of Maine. In New Jersey and Pennsylvania‚

it is rare, and only met with in moist and

shady situations. It is confounded b the

inhabitants of these countries with B. enta,

which is very abundant there, and to which

it bears a striking resemblance. In the dis-

trict of Maine, it is always found in cool and

rich soils, among ash trees, the hemlock

a moister soil than most of the other Ame-

rican birches. “ The wood of the yellow

birch is inferior in quality and appearance

to that of B. lenta, and never assumes so

dee a shade; but it is strong, and, when

wel polished, makes handsome furniture.

In Nova Scotia, and in the district of Maine,

ployed for making the hoo s of casks.” ΞΝ. Amer. Syl„ vol. ii. p. 105.) The wood
is excellent for fuel, and t e bark is hig ly esteemed by tanners. Boards of this
tree were formerly imported into Ireland and Scotland in large quantities‚ and
were much used in jomery. Michaux considera it better adapted to the soil
and climate ot Germany than to those of France, on account of the moisture
which it requires. Though this species has been in British ens since 1767,
when it was introduced by Mr. Gordon of the Mile En Nursery, yet it is
not common in collections. There are planta in the arboretum of Messrs.
Loddiges‚ but they are small; and to us they appear to bear a close resem—
blance in their leaves to B. lenta. Willdenow mentions that there are no
large trees of this kind about Berlin. Planta, in the London nurseries, are
