In order to make paper, it is soaked for three or four hours in water3 aster which
the extet-nal skin, and the green internal coat‚ are scraped off, and the strong-
eat and· firmeet pieces are selected; the produce of the younger shoots being
of an inferior quality. Ifany very old portions resent themselves, they are,
on the other hand, rejected as too coarse. All notty parts, and every thing
which might impair the beaut of the paper, are also removed. The chonen
bark is boiled in a lixivium til its down fibres can be separated by a touch of
the fin er. The pulp so produced is t en agitated in water till it resemblee
tufts σέβων. If not sufficien tly boiled, the paper will be marae, though strong 3
if too much, it will be white, indeed, but deficient in strength and solidity.
Upon the various degrees and modes of waahing the pulp, much also depende
as to the quality and beauty of the aper. Mucilage obtained stom boiling
rice, or from a root ealled or‚eni( oevnpfi,474.), one of the mallow tribe, ia
afterwards added to the pulp. The paper is finished much after the European
mode, except that stalks of rushes are used instead of bra-sa wires.” (Pen. Cyn„
art. Broussonetia) The India or Chinese paper used sor taking proofs of en-

vings is thus made. In Otaheite, the bark of this tree is made into dreasee.

lanta are readily propagated by layers, auehere, or cuttings of the root.
