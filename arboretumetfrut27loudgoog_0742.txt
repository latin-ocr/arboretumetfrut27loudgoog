Varieties. These may be arranged in two classem those which are considered
botanical variatim, and those which are cultivated on account of their fruit.

A. Botanical Vmieties.

2 C. v. 2 asplemfilia Lodd. Cat.,1836; C. heterophylla Hort.; C. laciniam
Hort.; C. salicifolia Hor-t„ has the leaves cut into shreds, regularly,
or irregularly, and sometimes so as to appear like linear-lanceolata
leaves; and hence the epithet of salicifolia.

2 G. v. 3 cochleam Lodd. Cat„ 1836, has the leaves cuculae, or hooded,
with a diseased stunted appearance.

‘k C. v. 4- gldbra Lodd. Cat„ 18:363 C. v. foliisnlucidus Hort.; haa the leaves
rather thin, 8ηά more shining than those of the species.

2 C. v. 5 glana-a, C. glafica Hor-t„ has the leaves somewhat glaucous.

1 C. ο. 6 υαήεςᾶεας C. v. foliis aureis Lada. Cat„ 1836 ; has the leaves vari-

with yellow, with some streaks os white3 and the trec, when
o a larger size, makes a splendid appearance in spring, and is adini-
rably adapted sor planting amo evergreen shrubs, along with the
baisam oplarfthe colour of w ich, when the leaves first expand,
has all τεο rich yellow of this variety, with the advantage of being
associated in the mind with ideas of health; whereas variegation is
known to be generally the effect of disease.

τ c. v. '7 amacina,- cluzam Μῑειω. Ν. amer. syl„ iii. p. 9.-m miety
has broader leaves than the European chestnut.

’ Β. Fruit-bemiug Varieties.

In the French catalogues these are very numerous ς 8ηά in De auhn-uh
Stafistiques de Sam, δια, it is stated that betweewffl 8ηά 50 varieties are
cultivated in the province of Mondovi, in Piedmont. (See Gara. Mag„ vol. i.
p. 322.) There are u warda of 20 sorts cultivated in the London Horti·
cultural Society’s Gar en, os which Mr. Thompson considers the four ibl-
lowing as· deserving the reference for ornamental cultivation ε - 0118·-

The nurserymen in the south of Devonshire, and in Jersey‚ generally pay
more attention to the sweet chestnut, as a fruit trec, than the nurserymen in
the neighbourhood of London. There is said to be atree of a very superior
van'ety in a garden in St. Peter’s parish, Jersey‚ from which, it is believed,
planta are propagated in Saunders’s Nursery, in that island. (See Ger-d.

viz„ les cluitm'gnes and les mar-rom ,· the former being to the latter what the
crab is to the apple. The latter are, of course, much preferred, being larger,
more farinaceous‚ and sweeter. When roasted, they have also a rich meamy
flavour, 8ηά an aromatic odour, in which the common chestnuts are quite
deficient. The best marrona sold in Paris are the marrona de Lyons; and
the best kinds os the common chestnut are ε - La chataigne de Bois, the
fruit of which is small, will not keep, and is of little flavour3 and the trec
forms the principal coppice-wood in the neighbourhood of Paris: la Cha-
taigne ordinaire, of which the fruit is rather better, 8ηά the tree more
vigorous, and 8 greater bearet: la Chataigne pom-taleme, the fruit of which
is very fine, and produced in great abundance: la Cha ' e printaniere,
the fruit of which has no other merit than that of being pro uced very early
in the reason ε 18 Chataigne verte du Limousin, which produces very large
excellent fruit, which will keep a long time, and the trec ofwhich preses-ves
its leaves een much ‘lon er thanssany of the other varieties: 8ηά 18 eha-
