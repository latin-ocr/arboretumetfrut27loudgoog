with a diameter of from 18 in. to 24 in. It is eeslly reeognised by its berk,
which is of silver grey, and but slightly furrowed3 by its ample leaves, and
by its vide-sdffioedmg head, disproportioned in size to the diameter of its
trunk. It ers from other trees, also, m the sewness of its branches.’'
(Ν. Amer. Sylva, ii. p. 64.) The catalpa is a tree of rapid growth, sud
its timber is remarkabl “
lished ε its colour is οἶα greyish white3 and, when properly sessoned, it is
very durable. If a portion of the berk of this tree be removed in spring,
“a venomous and offensive odour is exhaled.” The bmk is said to be
tonic, stimulant, and more powerfully antiseptic than the Peruvian bmkg
and the honey collected from its flowers to be isonous, and analogous in
its effectu to that made from the flowers ο θεὶεὲηιὶαηι nitidum. The

The tree is of rapid growth till it attnins the heffht of 20 ft„ which, in deep
free soil, in the. neighbourhood of London, it oes in 10 years. Seedling
plsnts begin to flower, under favourahle circumstances, in 12 or 15 years3
and, in soils and situations where the wood is well ripened, they continue
flow ⁸ every year, making a splendid sp ce, not only from the lar
size anzl lively eolour of the flowers, which are white, marked with purp e
end yellow spots, but from the fine pale green of its very large leaves, which
are of a different shade of green from those of almost every other tree ς. the
