ln the Compardon to the Botardoat Magada& it is
stated that S. berbecea exceeds in the elevation of
its habitat every other shrub in Britain (p. 89.) 3 and
that ‘fewhmnofsoooroooyardsinssriminare
without S. herbacea, whilst S. reticuleta iz probably
limited to the Scottish H· blanda, and not very
plentiful there.'’ (p. 222.) . herbacea is the least ¹349
of British wiuows, and, according to Sir J. E. Smith, the least os
all shrubs. Dr. Clarke, in his Smndhaavia, calls it a perfect tree in
miniature3 so small„ that it may he taken up, and root, trunk, and
branchee spread out in a small pocket-book. Accordin to Hooker (Br.
FL, ed. 2.), it is not ‘⁸ ao small as is generallysu sed, or its stema divide
and creep below the sui-face of the earth, y rising l in. above it.’‘ In
ed. 3., it is stated, on the authority of Dr. Graham, that “in the Bo-
tanic Gai-den of Edinburgh it has acquired a prostrate wood stem, 2 st. to
Βῆ. long, and as thick as the little finger! Under the ead Varieties,
we have noticed some planta which may belong to this species, and
which have stems 2 st. οι· 3 st. high. The leaves of S. herbacea are em-
loyed, in Icela'nd, in the tanning of leuther. (Lindi. Nat. Syst. Boe.) S.
gethaeam is called by the Laplnndera the ptarmigan leaf. (Walzlenberg,
quoted in Eng. Fl.) In Switzerlend, M. Alphonse De Candolle observes,
