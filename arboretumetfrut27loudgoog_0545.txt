Nichols appears to refer to Q-pedunculata, when he speaks of “the true
English oak, such as are standing about Rinefield Lodge,” in the New ‘Forestg
‘⁸ finer trees, or better timber for ship-building, than which, 1 believe‚'’ he adds,
“ are not to be found in the kingdom.'' Another oak, which, he sayS, ‘⁸ the
workmen in the forest call the durmast oak,'' and which, from his reference to
Miller's Dictionmy, and his observations in another work, appears to be the
Q· sessiliflora, has the wood “ not so strong, hard, or durable, as that of the
English oak,'’ which, he continues, ‘⁶ is well known 811 over the world as prefer-
able for ship-building.” The difference between the quality of these two kinds
of oak, he adds, was not known in the year 1700, when some of the enclosures
in the forest were planted with acorns taken from the durmast 0811. (Obser-
vatiom on Oak Treer, ὄπ, in a Letter to the Earl qf matham, p. 26.) This
durmast oak, he describes (in a Leuer on a new Way of plantis: Aconas,
&c., included in his Methodt fin· debreasmg' the Consumption qs Tim in the
Navy, &c.) as having “ the acorns in c usters close to the twig‚ without
any footstalks; and the leaves with short stalks, usually about half an meh in
length.” (p. 67.) The acorns of the true English oak, on the other hand, he
says, “ grow on fruit stalks, like cherries, from about l in. to 2 in. in length3
