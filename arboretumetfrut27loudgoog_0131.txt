Description, ἀσ. The elms are long-lived trees, with hard wood; , and
sometimes corky, bark; and zigmg, aomewhat slender, branchea. T e leaves
are alternate, stalked, deciduous,in general serrated and harah ς un ual at the
base, and ⁶ tusts of hairs at the axile of the rimary veina. T e flowera
are earlier than t e leaves, tusted, copinas, and dar red3 the capsulea are ale,

suppleness. The communen and perhaps all, the kinds increase rapidlyin
the number and the mze of their roots and branches. U. campestria emita

mekera from the older roota, which are extended under the sul-face os the
soi13 but this ia not the case with U. montana. All have strong upright-
‘ng trunks; but these vary, in the several kinds, in their diameters and
ength. The disposition of the branches relatively to the trunk, and to the
head which they constitute, also varies exceedingly ς and considerable dif-
ference of character prevails in the spray. For example, the tusted twi a
of U. campestris bear very little resemblance to the prominent wand- ' e
ahoots which stand out thinly over the aurface of the heads os youn
trees of U. montana, and all ita varietien, or allied speciem though ιιι ol
trees the branches s read horizontally, and become drooping at their extre-
mities. The tusted a oota of U. campestria assume occasionally the character
of knota of entangled cord3 and those tusta are called witch knotsin some
places. The character os the foliage ia nearl the aame in all the kinds of
elm. That of U. campestris is very striking. rom the amallneaa os the leaves,
their number, the depth of their green, and their somewhat rounded re:
they remain on, also, till very late in the year. In U. montana, U. m. g abra,
U. americana, and in some other kinds, the leaves are large, long, and some-
times ‘ ted, with the ωαέξὶηῶ teeth more obvioua, though, perhapS, onlf¹

off much earlier, than those of U. cam ⁶ . The different kinds v , alno,
considerably in their time of leafing. eleaves of all the sorta have e base
unequal, the margins doubly dentated, and are feather-nerved. The flowera
are always protruded before the leaves, and are disposed in small group³‚
