of seeds, if they be either visibly diseased‚ or ill formed, should be passed over
by the collector. Elm seeds should be gathered the moment they are ripe, which
is readil y known by their beginning to fall. If the gathering is delayed for a
single day, the seed is liable to be blown off, end scattered by the slightest gale.
(Plant. Cal„ p. 412.) The seeds, whether sown immediately when guther-ed,
or in the following spring, ought to be deposited in light or friable rich soil, and
very thinl , in order that the lants that rise from them may be strong and vigo-
rous. 1f t ey rise too thickl t e first ear, they are for several ears aster sensi-
bl affected, continuing w , althoug caresully thinned out. he best sorm in
w ich the seed can be de sited is in beds3 and the covering of soil should
not be more than ᾗ in. tffik. (Id.,p. 283.) The plants may be transplanted
into nursery linea, either at the age os one or two years; and they may be
grnsted the following spring. If not intended to be grafted, the may go
through a regular course of nursery culture, till they have attained t e desired
height; and they will transplant readily at 20 st. or 25 ft„ though not nearly
so well at that size as the U. campestris. Few plants succeed more rendily
by grafting than the elm3 so much so, that when the grast is made close to
the surfnce os the soil, and the scion tied on with matting, the mere earthing
up of the plants from the soil in the intervals between the rows will serve as
a substitute for claying. The graft, in our opinion, should always be made 6 in.
or Sin. above the collar, in order to lessen the risk of the scion, when it
becomes a tree, throwing out roots; which, in the ease of all the varieties of
U. campestris, would become troublesome by their suckers.
