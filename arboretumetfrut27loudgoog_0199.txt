Desa-iption, ᾅσ. ln the general remarks on the walnuts and hickories quoted
ffiom Michaux, it was observed, thet, while the hickories bore a great family
resanblanee to esch other, yet that they differed considerably in the number
and size of their leaflets‚ and in their fruit: but, notwithstanding this dif-
ferenee, an extraordinary uniformity of structure pervades the timber os
the whole of the hiekories. “ So close an analogy ensts in the wood of these
trees, that, when ' ped of their berk, no differenceis discernible in the grain,
‘which is coarse ο n o ¹¹. in all ς nor in the colour of the heart5wood, which

is peculial-ly hable to tpjury legi-n 'wei-ms. It ‚¹⁸⁹ consequently, never used m
buildmg houses or ships ς but 1t ιε found admirably adapted for the axletrees
of , the bundles of axes, and for Ι e screws, particularly those of
bookbin ers' presses. It is also used for t e bscks of chairs, conch-whip
handles, musket-stocks, rake teeth, flails for thrashing grain, the bows of okes,
and many similar purposes. The principal use of the hickory in the nited
states is, however, for forming hoops for casks3 and it is the only American
wood which is found persectly fit for that purpose. “ When it is considered

consequence of this great demand, hicko vyood is becommg scarce ς particu-
larly as the shoots do not sprout a secon time from the same root, and the
growth of young plante is slow. In sloo s and schooners,the wooden rin by
which the sails are hoisted, and confin to the mast, are always of hi ory.

species have very long taproots‚ which are nearly destitute of fibi-es. This
remark, however, does not appl to C. amara, which, hke Juglans nigra, has
abundance of fibrous roots. {he ρ’ -nut (C. porcina) end the mocker-nut
(atomentosa) are considered to affor the best timber-3 and the paeane-nut
(0. olivaeformm) decidedly the best fruit, though small. Michaux suggests the
probability of im roving it in size by grafting it on the common, or black,
