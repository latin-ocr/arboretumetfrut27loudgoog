dant in the bark3 and, consequently, the spray always yields more in propor-
tion than the trunk. The bark is much employed for tanning leather, both
in Britain and on the Continent. The birch applears to have been first used
in England for this purpose in Evelyn's time, as e s eaks of “ Mr. Howard’s
new tan, made of the tops and loppings of birch.” T e bark ‘elds a yellowish
brown dye, and, combined with alum, 8 brownish red. T ese may be con-
sidered as the principsl uses of the birch tree in centra] Europe; but there
are others to be noticed, which are peculias to Norway, Lapland, Russia,
8ηά the Highlands of Scotland.

In Lapland and Kamtsohatka, the huts are constructed with birch branches
covered with turf; and faggots of the spra with the leaves on, in cases formed
of the skins of reindeer‚ serve for seets uring the day, and beds at night.
An interesting view
of some of these
huts is given by Dr.

Clarke in his Scan-
dinavia, of which
our fig. 1552. is a
copy. The bark of

The earth over the bark is sometimes cultivated3 though it is most commonly
kept under grass. Dr. Clarke mentions that, “ on some of the roofs of the
Norwegian cottages, after the hay was taken, he found lambs pasturing; and
on one house he saw an excellent crop of turnips.” (See Emyc. (ζέεν-ἑ, ed.
