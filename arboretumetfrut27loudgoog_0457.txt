In the Highlands of Scodand, Sang observes, birch may be said to be the
universal wood. “ The Highlanders make every thing of ιι : they build their
houses of it3 make their beds, chairs, tables, dishes, and spoous of it 3 con-
struet their mills of it3 make their carts, ploughs, harrows, gates, 8ηά fences
of it3 and even manufacture ro of it! (Pl. Kal„ p. 80.) The branches
are emploved as fuel in the dis “ tion of whisky3 and they are found ιο con-
tribute a flavour to it far superior to that produced by the use oi: fir-wood, coal,

for tanning leather, dyein yellow, making ropes, and sometimes, as m Lap-
land, instead of candles. . 'flue spray is used for thatching houses3 and, dried
in summer with the leaves on, it makes an excellent material for sleeping
upon, where heath is scarce. The wood was formerffly used ‚in the Highlands
for arrows 3 and the berk, it is said, on the sea coast, or making boats, as that
of B. yracea is in North Ameriea.

In ad ition to the above, we might enumerate a number of minor uses
mentioned by authors, when speaking of the tree as belonging ιο the most
northern parts of Europe 3 and some of which, we have reason to believe, are
now become obsolete. Among these are what Evelyn calls “ the whitest part
of the old wood, found commonly in doati birches‚” from which, be says, is
made “ the ground of our effeminate-form gallants' sweet powder3 ’³ and of
the 3⁰³oe consumed and rotten wood,'’ he says, is “ gotten the best mould

e raising of divers seedlings of the best plants and flowers.’' (Hunter's

for
Evelyn, vol. i. p. 224.) The use of the birch in artificia} plantatione, in Britain,
is chiefly as an undergrowth‚ and as coppice-wood. In both cases, it is cut,
every 5 οι· 6 years, for brooms, hoops‚ wattle-rods, crateware‚ &c.3 every
lo or 12 years, for faggot-wood, poles, fencing, 8ηά ban-k for the tannem, the
value of which, in Scotland, is about half that of oak bark 3 and not oftener
than once in every 15 or 20 ears, when it is wanted for herting casks. In all
these cases, the spray is us for become, rods, ties, and similar purposes. In
the Highland districts, standard trees are lest to attain a timber size. The
birch, as already observed‚ is very frequently used as a nurse to other trees3
and especffl to the oak, the chestnut, and other hard woods.. Many of the
extensive plantations made by the late Duke of Portland ιιι Nottingham-
shire were raised between rows of birch trees, planted two-or three years
before the acorns were sown 3 as has been recorded in detail by Speechly,
and by Hunter in his edition of Evelyn's Sylva, 8ηά in his Georgical Essa s.
