wood of willows, whether that of the trunks and branches‚ or of the young
shoots, is smaller, harder, tougher, and more compact and durable, 11188 11181
of willows own in rich moist soils. In dry soils, also, the growth of the
plant 18 11188 slower than in moist ones. From these data, it may reason-
ably 118 deduced, that, when the object of growing willows 18 10 preserve the
forms which they have in their natural 1181111818, 111888 1181111818 should be imi-
tated 88 much 88 possible 3 and 11181, 011 1118 contrary, when the object is to
ascertain what are species, and what only varieties, the soil and situation
should be uniform for all the sorts, of a richer quality, and of a description
more favourable for rapid growth, 111811 what occurs to the average number of
80118 18 8 81818 of nature. Where bulky produce, either in timber, branches,
rods, or twigs, is the object, the soil ought to be good, and the situation and
‘other circumstances favourable to rapid growth. The best situation, when
the object is free and rapid growth, 18 on the sides of rivers and brooks which
pass through a level country. In such situations, the timber-producing kinds

the moi-erare alpine kinds root with ‘ culty. Some species ropagate very
readily from seeds3 and there ean be little doubt that ing, 8ηά other
