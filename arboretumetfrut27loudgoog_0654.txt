willow oak, by which this s ecies is known
throughout the greater part o America. The
shoots are straight, long, slender, wand-like, and
not crossing one another so much as in most of
the other kinds of oaks3 so that the tree is almost
asmuch like the willow, in its shoots as its leaves.
The acorns, which are rarely abundant, are
small, round, bitter, and of a dark brown co-
lour: they are contained in shallow cups, slightly ⁴
coated with scales3 and, if kept in a cool p ace,
they will preserve the power of germination sor '
several months. The most northern boundary
os the willow oak is Philadelphia3 but it ιο

willow oak generally grows in cool moist plaees3 and, with §ssa aquatica,
M ὸΙία glauca, moer rubrum, Lam-us carolinensis, and Quercus aquatica, it
bor ers the swamps in the lower part of the southern states. But, though
the willow oak generally grows in moist places, it is sometimes found, along
with the live oak, “near the sea, in the driest and most sandy soils. At a
distance, it resembles the live oak in its shape and in its foliage, which, in those
situations, persists during several years ς but, on a closer examination, it is
easily distinguished by the form of its leaves, which are shorter and narrower,
and by the porous texture of its wood.” (Id.) Catesby calls this oak Q.
I *lex marylandica, after Ray3 and mentions that, in 1723, it was growing in
the garden of Mr. Fairchild. He adds that this tree is the favourite resort
os the large white-billed woodpecker, which seeds upon the insecta found in
its bark, and injures the tree so much in dislodgin them, that the ground
under the tree is often covered with small chips. rom this circumstance,
the Spaniards call the birds carpentem& (Catesb. Car-ol„ i. p. 16.) Michaux
adds that the wood is reddish and coarse-grained, and so porous, that its
staves are classed with those of the red oak. From the comparative rareness
of the tree, however, they are seldom in the market.- In some of the lower
parts os Virginis, the wood of Q. Phellos is found to possess great strength
