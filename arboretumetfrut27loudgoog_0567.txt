Maakew says, ‘³ The easiest way to procure good oak knees is to look out
in hedgerow' and open forest for 'planta which divide into two or four leaders,
stom 5st. to 10 st. above onnd; and, should the leaders not diverge suf-
ficiently, to train them as orizontally as possible for several feet, by rods
stretebrugcacross the top, or by fixing them down by stakes.’' (On Nava!

Perhaps it would notuge difficult to construet a table, to show the roportion
between the annual increase of the trunlt at a certam distance from e ound,
and the annual amount of timber added to the tree3 and, the price timber
