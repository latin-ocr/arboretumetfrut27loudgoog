treoe are kept as low bushee, aud the shoots are never allowed to attein more

than three or four years' growth3 because it is necessary to bendtbem down to

the ground, and retain them there, by means of salies, or stenes, or a mass of

occustom to the fige of Mareeillee. They are, onya the writer, always either
insipid or half rotten3 and, even to bring them to this state, it is necessary

to pinch off the points of the shoots, in the same way as is done with the vine

when early grupen are wanted3 or with the peu, to accelerate the maturity of

the pods. An additional process is requieite in cold sennenn, and αι the latter

has been in use for an unknown length of time in the Levant, was first men-
tioned by Tournefort3 and, though it is hughe-d at by many of the French phy-
aiologisoe of the present day, we cannot help thinking that it must be of some

 

important nee. It is ed by Bosc that ιι hae no other object than that of ,

bastening the maturity o the cropg but others are of opinion that,by insurin

the fecundation of the etigmiuit tends to increase the aize of the fruit, and, by -
ing it with mamre seeds, to render it more nourisbing. Olivier, the botanical
traveller‚as⁸erts that, astet a long residence in the islanda os the Archipeleg'p, he
is convinced of the inutility of the practice3 and Bosc, though he allows t at it
may hasten the maturity os the fige, as the larva of the ρξ’-518 pommonelle hastens
the maturity of the a ple in France, yet believes that it ns no effect in improving
either the aize or e flavour of the fruit. M. Rerum-d, the author of a
