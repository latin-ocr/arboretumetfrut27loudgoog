Sentis to Georgiga distance ofleoo miles3 but it isfoundinthegreatest
perfectiori in Lower Canada, New answick, Nova Secum the north-eastern
section of the United States, and Genessee in the state of Ner York. The
white elm delights in low humid situations ς soils such as, in the northern states,
sre called interval lands. In the middle states, it grows in similar situations,
and on theborder of swamps. West of the mountains, it abounds in all the fer·
tile bottoms watered by the great rivers that swell the Ohio and the Mis-issippi,
particularly on the brink of the rivers, whoee its base is inundated at the rising
ofthe waters in the spring. The wood is used for the ssmedpurposes· as the
Europeen elm,but it is decidedly inferior in strength and har πως it has also
less compactness, and splits more readil . The barli is said to be easily de-
taehed during eight months of the year. gooked in water, snd rendered supple
by pounding‚ it is separated into shreds, or ribands, which are used, in the
northern states, for weeving into sests for common chaire, as rushes are in
England. (Madian-r.) This tree was introduced into England in 1752, by
Mt. James (ἱστάσης though, as Martyn observes, no notice is taken of it, or
of an other American elm, in the edition of Miller’s Diclionmy which was
publ' ed sixteen years afterwards. The threeverieties have doubtless existed
in the arboretum at Kew, and, probably, in the grounds at Syon; but the are
not now to be found in either of these collectione. The only plants which we
have seen are those in the Horticultural Society's Garden3 where there are
several from 15 st. to 30st. in height. The bear a general resemblance to
U. montana, both in their naked and clo ed state; but they are readily
distinguished stom that species by the roughness of their bark- The leaves,
also, are more pointed, longer in repon-tion to their breadth, have longer foot-
ωε, and are of a finer green. h so closely resemble other trees, marked,
in the Horticultural Society’s Gar eu, U. hispfinica', as scarcely, isat all, to
be distinguishsble from them. Michaux sent seed· of this elm to France in
1807,fi·om which several thousand plants were raised3 and ofwhich,acco ⁰ to
the Noweau Du Hamel, there are very fine specimens at Trisnon, where ey
are distinguished from all other elrns by the superior beeuty of their leaves.
Cobbett informs us that he imported a uantity of elm seed stom the borders
of Lake Ontsrio, which was gathered rom a tree that had a clear straight
stem 70st. high, before it began to rsmify3 but that these seeds, from having
been put together before they were thoroughly dried, had fennented on the
