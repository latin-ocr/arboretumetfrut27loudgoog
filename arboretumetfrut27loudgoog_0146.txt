primary channel, on eac side of it.
(See fig. 1236.) The true food of the
insect is the inner bark 3 and the
erosion of the nost wood is so slight,
as to be, perhaps, nearly accidental.
The course of each individual larva,
on each side of the primary channel, is
about parallel to that of the larva next
to it3 aud each forms a channe} by its
feeding that is enlarged as the larva
increases in aize. When each larva has
finished its course of feeding it stops in

hole through the bark, 8ηά comes out.
The beetlea begin to come out in
about the latter end of Ma of the year
following that in which t e egga were
deposited. The s es afterwards pair,
and the famulas, ehem-ing eggs, bore
thrlough the bark, as before detailed; and so on from generation to generation,
an ear to ear.

Τέε resulty of the erosions of the female ent, aud of the larva, in the inner
burk and sost wood, is that of cutting o the vital connexion between these
two parts3 and, when the erosions effected in a tree have become numerou8‚ of
occasioning its death, by preventing the ascent and deseent of the sap. It
has been said that the acolytus never attacks a tree in a perfectly healthy
state5 and, also, that trees suffering under carcinoma (see p. 1385.) are par-
ticularly liable to it. ln the year 1825, an avenne of elm trees in Camberwell
Grove were attacked by this disease, which was supposed to be brought on
by the which escaped from the pipes laid down along the road being
absor by the roots; and which ve nse to a suit in Chaucery between the
inhabitants 8ηά the proprietors of t e gwworks. Various persons, considered
as competent judges‚ were employed to ascertain the cause of the decay of the
elms; and their general conclusion was, that the carcinoma had been brought
on by old age, excavations for build· in an exceedingly dry soil, 8ηά an extraor-
dinarily dry summer, and that the gas ad had no influence in producing the decay
of the trees. The trunks of the trees, when examined in 1826, were found
infested with an immense number of larvae feeding on the sost inner burk. An
interestin account of the Camberwell elms will be found in the Gardener’ae Ma-

has also been remarked that the ’acolyti seldom destroy the tre} they attack
the first year that they commence their ravages3 8ηά that they prefer a tree
that they have already begun to devour, to a young and vigorous tree.
(See the observatione of ΜΓ. S ice in p. 1:289.) It is easy to ascer-
tain the infested trees, as the bas will be found perforated b small holes,
as if made by shot or a brad-awl, in various parts3 and ittle pai-tides
of a substance like fine sawdust will be found on the rough surface of the
berk, and at the foot of the trec. The acolyti, as Mr. Denson‚ sen, has
observed, never attack dead trees, The Scolytus destructor, as an enemy to
elm trees, appears first to have attracted the attention of entomologists in
England about the year 1824, by M‘Leay’s Report to tlte fleatur-y upon
the state of the elms in St. James’s and Hyde Parks. (See this Report iu
Edin. Phil. ἆσαι-8., No, xxxi. art. 12.'; and see Tilloch’s Pm. Mag„ Oct. 1823,
art. 51.) ln the year 1828, a controversy was carried on in a Cambridge
newspaper, between ΜΓ. John Denson, sen„ the author of A Pmoent’e Voe'ce
