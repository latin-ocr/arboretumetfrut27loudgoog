soil is dry and· meagre. In such situations, it commonly attains the height
of eost. or 25ft.; but single trees, in moist plaees, grow to nearly double
thatheight, with trunks from Sin. to 9in. m diameter. It is less com-
mon in Amerina than' any other species of birch, being rarely found in
groups; and single trees are met with only at considerab e intervals. It is
most eommon in the district of Maine; but, even there, it is only seen b the
sides of the highways, and in sandy soils that have been exhausted b c tiva·
tion. The wood is very soft, brilliant when polished, 8ηά perfect y white;
but it speedily decays, and, in Amet-ica, is employed for no purpose, not even
for fuel. The twigs are too brittle for common brooms. It was first culti-
vated in England by Archibald Dulce of Ar ll, at Whitton, in 175ος 8ηά it
is to be met within the principal British an Continental nurseries. When
the plants are raised from seed, they make very handsome trees; and, as seed
is freely produced, this mode ought alwa s to be adopted: but lants from
layers se dom attain any magnitude. he l t trees that we now of in
the neighbourhood of London are at Purser’s ross and Syon3 where, how-
ever, the are under 50st. in hei t. In the Fulham Nursery, there is one
