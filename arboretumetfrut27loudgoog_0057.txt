Spec. Char„ ⁴3⁶0· Evergreen. Leaves oval, lanceolam, slightly giencourt be-
nenth. Flowers in peduncled axillnry groups. (Sp-eng.. 238⁸ss ¹¹· 1³:2⁶5)
An evergreen tree, a native of North Amet-ica, from ergxma to Immmanm
introduced in 1739, and flowering in May3 but seldom found in collectione.

Varieties.

2 L. c. 2 glabra Pursh has the leaves slightly glabrous.
2 L. c. 3 palme-ens Pursh has the leaves slightly pubescent.
2 L. c. 4* obnisa Pursh has the leaves ovate-obtuse.

Au these varieties were introduced in 1806; and they all flower from
May to July. In ourHortm Britannicam, and other modern catalogues,L.
narbonia and L. carolinennis are made distinct
speciem the former being said to be tender‚
and introduced in 1739, and the latter to be
hardy, and introduced in 1806. Both, however,
are said nobe the American red bay3 and in
Pursh's Fe. Amer. Sept.,'nnd in the Mna Ham„
they are considered identical. It appears pro-
beble that this isthe caceg and, as ιι a penrs
from Michaux (N. Amer. Sylva, ii. p. 150. ‚ that
the tree differs exceedin ly according to the lati-
tude in which it grows, . Borbonr'a (fig. 1168.)
may be the form it meumes in the southern
states, and L. carolinensin (fig. 1169.) its ap—
pearance in the more northern ones.

Der ' tion, ἅε. The red bay, thou h it sometimes, in the south os Georgia
and thffioridas, attains the height (Ξ gossft. or 70 ft.. with a trunk from 151⁸.
