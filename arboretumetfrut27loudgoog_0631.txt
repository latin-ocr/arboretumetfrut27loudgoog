deners published in that year (see p. 68.); and it was one of
ῗὲ oaks stated by Catesby to be, in his time, ‘⁴ growing at Mt. Fair-
child's.” There are trees of this oak at Messrs. Loddiges’s, and in
⁸ the Horticuitural Society's Garden. The wood of this tree is
considered, in America, to be inferior to that of Q. alba, Q. obtusssoba,
and even Q· macrocarpa, though it is superior to the wood of the
American οὐκ comprised in the division Rubrae. It is too porous
for casks to contain wine or s irituous liquors 3 but it is used by
wheelwrights, and for other wor s which require strength and some
durability. ‘⁴ Aa it splits in a straight line, and may be divided into
fine shreds, it is chosen by the negroes for baskets and brooms.”
As osts and rails, it will last about 12 or 15 years, which is one
