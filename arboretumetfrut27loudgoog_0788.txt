fruit roundish, campanulate, longer than the nut3 limb spreading, dentgoely
eerrated. (Willd.) The American hazel is a shrub, owing, according to

as much as the filbert from the Euro hazel. The calyx is larger- than
the included nut, the flavour of the ernel of which ia naid to be very fine,

duced, in 1798, by the Marchioneas of Bute.- Planta, in the London
