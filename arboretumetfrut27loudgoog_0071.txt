was introduced in 1797, and is frequent in
collectione. Au elegant little shrub, with ter- π
minal penicles of sweet-emelling pink flowers,
which are succeeded by small, globular, red
beri-ies. The same deleterious properties are g
attributed to this shmb, as to the common -

mitable sor conservative rockwork. Dr.
