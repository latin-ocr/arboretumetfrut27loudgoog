White, in hia Natural Hister-y qt‘Serov-ne (see Brown’s edit„ p. 195.), mentions,
in a letter to Mr. Pennant, an oak in Newton Lane, which, on a misty day in
October, 1775, dropped so fast, that the cartway stood in puddles‚ and the
ruts ran water, though the ound in general was duaty.

Progress ο Oakssrom the corn. An oak, rung from an acorn aet by Robert
Marsham, sq„ at Sti-atton Strawleaa‚ near orwich, Α. n. 1719, measured, in
the spring of 1743, when 24 years old, 1 st. 7 in. in girt at 5 ft. from the ground3
and ιιι 1758, when 41 years old, its girt at the same height was 2 st. 82in.;

contente, du ’ 15 years. This oak‚we are informed by Robert Marsham, an.‚
the grandson o the plantet of the tree, was, in December, 1836, 13 st. in circum-
ference at 5 st. from the und, and 17 st. at 1 st. ς with a trunk 19 st. long clear
of branchee, and a remar ably handsome head3 it was 64 st. high. Two oaka,
planted by Manham in 1720 and 1721, ἰιι 1743 measured 2 st. 9gin„ and 2ft.

Denham Rectory, Bucka, in 1750, girted, at ita smalleat part, 8 . in 1817,
being then but 67 years of age: the total he' ht was 50 ft„ and the diameter
of ita head about 70 st. In the gai-den at S effield Place, Sussex, stands a
fine oak, which was set in the year 1745; and in 1815, when 70 years old, ita
trunk was 12 st. in circumference, ita clear bole 10 st.; at which height it
divided into branches that overapread an area of 75 st. in diameter. An
acorn was sown at Rickett, the seat of Lord Barrington, on the da of hia
birth in 1717. In November, 1790, it contained 95 ft. of timber, whic ,at 2⁸.
per foot, would nell for 91. 10³. The top was valued at about ll. 15⁸. The
girt, at 5 st. from the ground, was about half an inch more than Ost. The
increase of the girt, in the two last yeam, was 43 in. It grows in rich land,
worth ll. 52. an acre. (Rath. Soc. Pap„ &c.)
