and our fig. 1230.— A tree, according to -

Pallas, who mentions several varieties of it, ἱ

v common in all the woods of the south

of ssia, and varying in height from that

of a middle-sized nee to that of a diminu- ,

εἰη shrub, aeeordi to the soil and climate

in which it grows. t is very plentiful about

Caucasum through Siberia, it gradually be-

comes morescarceg but it occurs again about

the lake Baikal, where the inhabitants use

the leaves as a substitute for tea. It has

been treatedbymostbotanistsasas ' ς

but it is not nearly so distinct from . cam·

pesti-is as U. c. viminalis, which we know

to have been raised, b Mr. Masta-s, from ¹23⁰

seeds of the common {nglish elm. The wood of this variety, ac-
cording to Paua, when it assumes a trec-like form, is very hard and
tough; and it is veined with transverse lines. The root is also
beautifully variegated, and used by the turner and cabinet-maliet.
One of the subvarieties mentioned by Pallas has the barlt sornewhat
flingous or corky3 another has the branches slender, *nand-like, and
osa whitish grey. In mountain rocks, the branches are short and
thick3 but‚in aandy soils, the trees are small, and the sboots slcnder.
