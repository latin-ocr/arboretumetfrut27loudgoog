roundish. The trunk is covered with an aab-Q

coloured berk 3 and the wood, in Siberis, is said
to be reddish, being closer and a little hai-der

than that of other poplars. In the moist plains of Dahuria, the tree is
shrubby, because, according to Pallas, the grass is annually fired there3 and

the young shoots of all the trees being thus
injured, the are seldom found rising with a clear
stem. In t e spring, the belsam poplar is known
from all other species by the fine tender ellow
