leaves borne on 8 shoot that is developed in the same year with themselves.
Petiole of leaf not obvious3 disk of leaf elliptical, unequal at the base,
dentate. Indigenous to the west of Asia, and upon the shores of the Caspian
Sea3 and to Imiretta and Georgia, on the south of Mount Caucasus. (Ν. Du
Ham.) Introduced in 176ος flowering in April or May3 and growing to
the height of from 50 st. to 70 ft.

Description, &a The zelkoua, in its native country, according to Michaux,
is a tree of the largest size, growin to the height of from 75 ft. to 80 st., with
a tmnk of the diameter of about 4 . The trunk is straight and upright, often
attaining the height of 25 st. or 30 ft. before it
throws out a single branch. The base of the
trunk is not enlarged, like that of most other
trees, its thickness bein very little greater at
the surface of the rouu than it is at the point
of ramification. ike that of the hornbcam, it
is marked with longitudinal furrows like open
guttere. The head is large, tusted, 8ηά ver
much branched3 but the branches, thoug
widely extended, are more slender, and more
vertical iu their direction, than is generally the ⁴
ease with forest trees. The bark of the trunk is -
not grey and cracked, like that of the eltn or ,
the oak, but resembles rather that of the horn-
beam or beech. As is the case with those trees, ς
the sut-face of the bark of the zelkoua is smooth,
8ηά its texture is firm and compact; but it has
this remarkable difference, that, when the trec
becomes about 8 in. in diameter, it scales off
in large thin pieces. The flowers are small, of
a greenish brown, 8ηά smell like those-of the elder3 8ηά they are disposed in
groups along the shoots of the current year. The fruit is not larger than a
pea; and the seeds, which are contained in little gibbous capsules, having two
cells, are about the size of a grain of hemp-seed. In Imiretta (a pastoral
district lyin between Georgia 8ηά the shores of the Black Sea), where the
zelkoua is ound in the greatest abundance, the seeds ri 8 ἰ8 the mouth of
October; but¹in France they always drop off before they have completed
their maturity. This is the more remarkable, from the tree having been
introduced into France above seventy years ago, and there being at Versailles
a tree above fifty years old, in 8 most vigorous state of growth, which has
resisted the most severe frostS. The foliage strongly resembles that of the
elm in its general a pearauce. The leaves are borne on very short petioles,
and are generall rom lin. to 3in. long. They are alternate, and equally
dentated, or rat er crenulated3 differing, in this respect, from those of every
kind of elm known3 the leaves of the elm alwa 8 having every large indentation
accompanied by a smaller one. The leaves o the zelkoua are, also, of a much
firmer 8ηά drier texture than those of the elm; and, it is said, are not, like those
of the latter tree, liable to the attacks of insecta. When the first tree of this

The bole of the trunk was 20 ft. in length, and of nearly uniform thicknessg
and the proportion of beart-wood to the sap—wood was about three quarters
of its diameter. This tree was about fifty years old, but was still in a growing
state, and in vigorous health. (See Michaux’s Mbmoiresur le Zekkoua, Paris,
1831.) Descetnet, in his Tableau Hister-ique des Progre} de la Cultm des Arbres
ἃ Odessa, δια, describes this s eciesas a “losty and beautiful tree, a nativeof
Mingrelia and Caucasus, whic is distinguished by its shining n, broadl
crenulated leaves, and its smooth and greenish trunk.” p. 60. In Bri '
gardens, the rate of growth of this tree is· similar to t at o the beech or
common hornbeam 3 it attaining the height of 20 st. in 10 years.
