grows in poor rocky soil, lt
very seldom attains these di-

palustris ; the leaf terminating in a point. When beginning to unfold
m spring, the leaves are covered with a thick white down, and they
appear somewhat wrinkled; but, when fully expanded, they are per-
fectl glahrous, smooth, and of a delicate texture. The petiole,
whic 18 rather short, is yellow, and the colour becomes hrighter
and more conspicuous in autumn. The acorns are long, of an
oblong-oval shape: they are produced in ⁵ on a short peduucle,
and are enveloped for about one third os their length in -shaped

light brown colour. This oak, according to the younger Michaux,
is not one of those which grow promiscuously with other trees in
forest-⁴33 but it is found in small patches, in particular habitats, only
on high grounds, thickly strewed with stones, or covered with rocks.
‘⁸ Thus it is osten seen on the and rocky banks os the Hudson,
and on the shores of Lake Champ ain3 and still more frequently on
the Alleghanies‚ in Pennsylvania 8ηά Virginia.” On these moun-
tains, it 18 sometimes found where the soil is so meagre, that the
trees do not exceed 20 ft. or 25 st. in height, and their trunks 8in.
or 10 in. in diameter. In Pennsylvania, Virginis, and Maryland,
this species is known by the name of the chestuut οὺς while on
the banks of the Hudson it is called the rock oak3 and the younger
Michsux, combining the two names, calls it the rock chestuut oak.
It was introduced in 180ος 8ηά there are trees in the Horticultural
Society’s Gardeu, and at Messrs. Loddiges’s. The wood, though
too porous to be used 88 staves for casks to contain spirituous
liquors, is esteemed, in New York, next to that of the white oak for
the construction of ships. It is em loyed for the knees aud frames3
pieces adapted for which are rar y to be obtained from the white
oak3 while the rock chestuut oak, “ growing up,’' as Michaux suffe,
“ in a continual controvers with the winds,’' produces a t
number of twisted and croo ed branches, or large limbs, pe ectly
well adapted for the purpose. It is also considered superior to any
other s 188, except the live oak, for fuel. The bark, at New Yor
and in εἴπω lvania, is esteemed the best for tanning3 but only that
of the secon ary branches, and of the truuks of young trees, is em·
plo ed. Michaux suggests that the tree might grow in exposed
roc y places in Europe, where the acorns might be drop iu
crevices in the rocks, or planted in barren places, where e soil
appears incapable of other cultivation.
