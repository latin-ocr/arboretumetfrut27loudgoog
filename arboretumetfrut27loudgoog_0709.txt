the trunk of the purple beech mensures only Ost. Gin. in ‹ircum-

total height ofthe tree is between 50st- and 60st., and the diameter
of the head is 45 ft. It was planted in 1752, and was, consequently,
when seen by Dr. Neill, about 65 years old. It is altogether, says
the doctor, “a very· handsomely formed well-balanced tree. To a

they get a ιιι-οη purplish hue ς and on the very exterior they are
of a deep purp e; insomuch that the tree, when seen from a dis-
tance, appears clothed in black ;” and hence the name which it hears
in Belgium, of martae beeokenboom, the black beech tree. This tree
every year-repens seeds, from which numerous young plants have
been raised, e ter part os which have purple leaves3 and, in a
young hedge in . Smetz’s garden formed of seedling planta from
this tree, the deputation ‘⁴ observed every variety of hue in the

and none completely urple.'’ (p. 107.) This tree, in all robability,
is the same as that uded to by Bosc. On writing to lgr. Somme,
Director of the Botanic Garden at Antwerp, in May, 1837, he
informs us that the trunk, at 7 in. above the rast, is 15ft. 10 in. in
circumference ς but that at 6 . 7 in. above t e grast the circumfe-
rence is 3 ft. 10 in. less. The diameter of the head is 72 ft., and the
total height of the tree is 72 st. The handsomest purple beech in
land is at Enville3 and, when we saw it in 1831, it was between
60 and vost. high, clothed with branches to the ground, where
it extended over a space above 60st. in diameter. lt stands on
a small lawn in the measure-grounds, and is, consequently, pro-
tected stom cattle. The loftiest purple-beech in England is at Syon,
where, in 1834, it was 71 ft. high; the diameter of the trunk eft.
10 in., andos the head 61 ft. Ιι flowers, and occasionally ripens seed,
from which, however, we believe, no plants have yet been raised.
