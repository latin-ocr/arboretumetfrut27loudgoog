a trunk 4st. or δὴ. in diameter3 while in New
Jersey the tree is never above sort. high, with
a trunk only 4 in. or 5 in. thick. The bark is
thick, black, and deeply furrowed; and the
wood is reddisb and co ained, with open
pores, like that of the red o . The leaves are

leaves are t eellobed (like those shown in fig.
1751„ from the Histoire der Ckfner), except a
few on the summit, which are slightl falcated.
Generally, the lower branches of all trees of ⁸
this species, growing in moist and shaded situations, havetheir leaves tnlobed3
while those on the upper branches are falcated, with their lobes even more
arched than those shown in fig. 1750. This remarkable difference led the elder
Michaux to describe the specimens which he ι
found growing in very cold. bad land as Q. ⁷
triloba ς and on the young sboots of these spe-
cimens he frequently found leaves deeply den-
ticulated or lobed, like those of Q. rubra or
Q. coccinea, as represented at a in fig. 1751.
The stumps of trees that have been felled, also,
frequently send up sboots bearing leaves deepl y
denticulated at ” ht angles to the main rib.
Amidst all theseriffianges, however, the leaves
of Q. falcata preserve one striking character· ,
istic3 which is, that there is always “a thick
down u n the under side of the leaves, and

and contained m slightly scaly, shallow, top-
shaped cups, supported on short peduncles=
they resemble those of Q. Banisteri, and, like
them, preserve the power of germination for a
long time. The rowth of thls tree‚ according

to the elder Mic aux, »is extremely rapid and vigorous, even on the worst
soils. The most northern boundary of Q. falcata is the neighbourhood
of Allentown, in New Jersey, about 60 miles from Philadel hia. Even at
this distance, says the ¹younger Michaux, the leaves are ¹smal er than in the
immediate vicinity of t e city, where they begin to assume their appropriate
form. Farther south, Q. falcata is constantly found among the most com-
mon trees in the sorests; but it is less frequent near the mountains‚ and
in the country beyond. “ In Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, it.is known
by the name of the Spanish oak ; and, in the carolinas and Geor 'a, by that
of the red oak.’' Michaux adds that, in an old English work whi he found
in “ the library at Char-leston, it is said to have been called the S anish oak
by the first settlers, from the resemblance of its leaves to those o Q. Veldni,
which grows in Spain.’' If Q. AE‘gilops is the oak meant, the resemblance
must have been very slight. The name of the red oak was probably derived
from the great analogy between the wood of this species and that of Q. rubra.
The wood of the Spanish oak is, however, better than that of the latter, though
it is, also, too porous to contain wine or s irits; and, from its want of dura-
bility, it is considered greatly inferior to that of the oaks belonging to the
section A‘lbae. “ The principal merit of the Spanish oak,’' says the younger
Michaux, ‘⁸ consists in its bark. This is preferred for tanning coarse leather,
which it renders whiter and more supple; it is consequently sold, at Phila·
