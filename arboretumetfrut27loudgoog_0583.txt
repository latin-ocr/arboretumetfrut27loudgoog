attract currente of sap, and, in the last instance, even into a foreign channel;

proving what Du Petit Thouars, and other botanists, have long ago advanced

as their opinion 3 viz. that the growth of a tree is not caused by the motion

of the sap, but the movement of the latter

is caused by the distension of the various

members.” (J. Maia in θανά. ᾹῙα3., vol.

xii. p. 708.) The articholre l, or ouh<

strobile (fig. 1650. ), is probab y the ‘⁸ oak

nut '⁹ of the ancients: it is about the size of

a filbert, and, from its closel imbrioated

scales somewhat resembling a rstrobile or

an artichoke, it has so been termed. (Renum.

Mem, tom. iii. pl. 43. f. 1—12.) It is

produced by the Cynips quercus gemmae,

and is a most beautiful foliose gall ; for the

developement os the bud‚ although per·

verted, not being wholly prevented, the

leaves are gradually evolved. ‘⁸ These galls,”

says Professor Burnet, “ throw much light

upon the natural metamorphoses of lants, ,

especially on the transition from eavea to flowers, by the abortion of

the axis os the bud‚ and the leaves hence becoming whorled; and, when

the axis of each leaf (that is, its petiole and midrib) becomes in like manner

curtailed, the 1 assumes a still more florid form. Occasionassy, in the

oak, but more uently in the willow, the gallic acid changes the ordinary

green colour of t e abortive leaves into a bright red, giving the preter-

natural growth very much the appearance of a rose, and hence Salix Helix,

in which this occurs, has been not inaptl called the ‘ Rose Willow.' The

bedeguar, or hairy gall (Galla capillatis o the ancients), is a peculiar and

as wic s for lamps, but which, as Parkinson shrewdly observes, will not burn

‘ without oyle or other unctuous matter, as Pliny saith it will: was the same

as our cotton or woolly gall, the description of the ancient Galla lanata

readers doub ul; for the flocks os wool are said to have been envelo in a

hard case3 which structure is rather more analogous to that of our c ustered

galls, usually about six or seven in a group, and each the habitation of a

separate grub ς as in them the little hard galla containing the insecta are

included m a sost and spongy, though not woolly, material, and are defended

The oak beu-rign, described as “sticking close to the body of the tree,”
were, doubtless, the gdls produced by the Cynips quercus remuli, or C. q.

Bree with a very fine specimen of this gall, which he discovered, on the 22d
of February, 1837, on the root of an oak tree (just at the surface), and which
