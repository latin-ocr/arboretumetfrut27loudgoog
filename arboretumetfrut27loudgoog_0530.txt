Lochwood (the original residence of the Johnstone family) is situated. lt is

uite vigorous3 but most of the other trees are in a state of decay. There are
ilze remains of lai-ger oaks, the diameter of the trunk osone of which is 6 ft.;
hut little of its head remains.” An oak at Bar-jarg, in Nithsdale, in 1796, mea-
sured 17 ft. in circumfer-enee. In the year 1762, Lord Barjarg was informed
by some very old people‚ that, about 90 years previous to that date, the tree
had been hored, with a view to ascertain if it were sound, which it was ς and
from the margin of the hole hored some branches proceeded, one of which
was then (1762) a considerable hougli. (Walker’s Essayr, p. 6. The Blind

Lochaber, Dr. Walker mentions a tree which measured 24st. 6 in. in circum-
ference at 4 ft. from the ground. In the same county, Sir Thomas Dick
Lauder found the remains of a “ magnificent oak forest, not, as is commonl
the case, emhedded in peat earth, but lying on the surface of the solid grounciL
as trees would do that had been newly thrown down. Many years must have
elapsed since these trees were laid rostrateg for there is now a very old and
beautiful birch wood growing on e ⁴ground they formerly occupied. We
measured one of these trunks, and foun it to be 23 ft. long, without a branch3
16 ft. round the but end3 and llft. in circumference towards the smaller end,
under the fork. With the exception of an inch or two of the external part,
which was westher-wasted, it appeared perfectly fresh. It lay within a yard
of the root on which it grew; hut it was not easy to determine, from ap -
ances, how it was severed from it. The stump remaining in the roun was

Ellers ‘e‚ the native village of the hero W lace,
there is still standing “ the large oak tree‚’' among
whose branches it is said that he and 300 of his τ
men hid themselves from the English. Its cir-
cumference at the base is 21 st. ς and at 15 st„

13 st. 2 in. ε its height is 67 ft.; and the expanse of*-

its houghs is, 13. 45 ft„ w. 36 ft„ s. 30 ft„ Ν. 25 st.;

thus spreadin over an extent of 19 English, or

finest piece of oak timber in Scotland3 and its heauty has probably saved it

from the axe, for it, and its neighbour, the Capon Tree, seem to he a century

older than any of the other old trees in the county. The Capon Tree is also

an oak ς but it possesses quite a different character from that of the King of the
