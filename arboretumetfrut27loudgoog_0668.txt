this productim, it is not emeing, that its real namre was long unhown.

which it was found3 and by others, who discovered the real organs of fructifi-
cation of the tree, that it was a vegetable excrescence similar m its nature to
the galls caused by the unctures of the Cyni idae. This opinion was main-
tained even in 1711, b ᾗ. DeMarsigli, in a ‹Esse-taum written at Bologna,
and addressed to Μ. {alumen-1. In 1714, however, M. Cestoui addressed a
letter to the same philosopher, in which he clearly traced the identity of the
nature of the kermes, and that os the scale insects os the orange and other
trees. This letter is printed in the collection of the works of Vallisnieri,
with a short preface by the latter, who ap to have hesitated in adopting
the opinion of M. Cestoni. Very shorSy afterwards, however, the entire
history of the insect was traced by Messrs. Garidel and Emeric, correspond-
ents of the Academy os Paris3 who, prompted by M. Tournesort, by
daily examinatione os branches infected with the kermes, made themelves
fully acquainted with its history, and proved it to be a species os coccus.
(Gar-id. Aiae. Env„ 250„ t. 53. and 2.) Reaumur hasalso given a fuu account
of it in· his Me'moe'ree, tom. iv. mem. 1. pl. 5. In its natural state, tbe
kermes is of a shining pearance, and of the colour of a plum cova-ed with
a whitish bloom. ln xe state in which it is brought into the maa-ket, it

different stages in its existence. In the Proveueal age, they call it
“le ver,'’ and say of it, when it is in its earliest state activity, ⁰⁸ Le ver

stationary, and begins to attain its fullest size, they say, ‘⁶ Le ver commenee
d'eclore ς ” and, in its last state, in the middle or towards the end of Ma , the
insect is found reduced to a skin, covering its brood of egga, to the num of
1800 οι· 2000. The ‘crop of kermes is more or less abundant, according to
the state of the preceding winter3 when, therefore, there has been no frost,
and the weather has been erally mad, a good crop is expected, which is not
obtained every yearg an , as there is no trouble in plantmg or attendi to
the growth of the hermes, and as no other instrumente are required than
nails to the fin rs, it may be easily supposed that the harvest is a very unex-
nsive one. eniales are employed in collecting the kermes in the morning,
gfzfore the dew is off the ground; at which time the leaves aud the prickles of
the plants are less to be dreaded. Ex rienccd persons will thus collect n
couple of pounds’ weight per diem. Befgn (chres-uatium des Singula-iter, liv. i.
