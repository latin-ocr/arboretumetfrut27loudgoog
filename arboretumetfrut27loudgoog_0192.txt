soil, dry rather than moist3 but the fruit has the best flavour, and produces
most oil‚ when the tree is grown in calcetenus soils, or arnon ealcareous
rocks: in 8 wet-bottomed soil, whatever ma be the character o the surfaee,
it will not thrive. The walnut is not a soc‘ trec, and neither produces good
timber nor fruit when lamed in masses. Both on the Continent 8ηά in
England, it suceeeds wel as 88 avenne or rond-side tree3 and it forms an
excellent shelter for orchards and kitchen-gardens, when planted at such a
distance as not to injure them by its roots or by its shade. In ornamental
unds, the somewhat light yellowish and shinin green fol‘ of the walnut
orma a fiae contrast with that of other trees, oughontffi greater part
of ‘31⁶ season3 and the symmetrical form of the head accords well with
buil ‘nge-
. Gutta-ing and keepo'ng tlte Fruit. The fruit of the walum, both in France
and in England, is commonl knocked down stom the tree by thrashing
the extremities of the bran es (on which alone it is produced) with
long poles. By this rocess, Mr. Rogers observes, “ many of the points
os the branches are when, which causes the productioni of many spur·
like shoots, that afterwards bear flowers and fruit. Hence the custom
of beating a barren tree to make it bear.” (Fr-ait Cede„ p. 380.) Bosc con-
siders that beatmg down the fruit with poles is injurious to the tree3 but,
in France, he adds, as the trees are not in enclosures, this barbarous practice
is altogether unavoidable. 1f the trees were enclosed, he continueS, or if pro-
perty exposed by the road sides were sufficiently respected, it would be unne-
to beat down the nuts at all,as the wind alone, when the fruit is com-
letely matured, would be quite sufficient to detach it from the trec. This
has suggested to us the idea of using long rods, with a contrivance at their
extremities for takin fast hold of the branches‚ so as to admit of shaking
them power-fully, an thus obtaining by art the effect of a violent wind. ln
gethering up the fruit which has been either beaten down, or fallen naturally,
those nuts which have separated from the husks are kept by themselves, taken
home, and spread out on a boarded floor in an airy shed or granary, to the
depth of 3ι8. Here they are turned over daily, till they become perfectly
dry. Those fruita from which the husks have not separated in falling are
placed in little heaps on the ound, but still under cover ς and turned over,
and gently beaten, till the h separatas. In France care is taken to prevent
these heaps from fermentineg, or sweating, as it is called3 because that occa·
sions a change in the kern , and gives a taste to the oil. When the nuts have
been thoroughly dried, those not wanted to crusb for oil are laid by, often iu
wooden boxes or chesn, where they are not subject to the vicissitudes of the

nand, so deep as not to be reached by frost, b the beat of the sun, or by rain ς or
by placing them in dry cellars, 8ηά covering t em with straw. The latter mode is
that most commonly adopted by the growers of this nut for the London market.
Walnuts, Rogers observes, should not be gathered till the outer coveri parts
readily from the shall, which is before that coverin becomes mealy. T ere is
a critical time at which the covering leaves the she l without staining it, which
it is apt to do if allowed to remain on till it becomes sost. After being shelled,
the nutos should be well dried in the sun for a day or two, and then stored

of lanting in the following spring, it should be laid in a rot—heap as soon as
cred, with the husk on3 and the heap should be turned over trequently in
ἵει course of the winter. We have entered into eater details res ’
