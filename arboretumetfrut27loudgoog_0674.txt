Devonshire, at Mamhead, about 8 miles from Exeter. In 1834, the eircum-
ference os the trunk of this tree, at 1 st. from the ground, was 12 st. oin. The
height of the trunk‚ before it branched off, was 10 st„ and the total height of

In Ireland, in the neighbourhood of Cork, on the estate of Sammerstown
there is a eork tree of unknown age, and which is thought by some to have
stood there for several centur-ies. Several generations , it must have been
a remarkable tree, for the then propi-letor, when lettingffi land on which the
tree stands, introduced a clause into the leuse, by which the tenant incur-red
