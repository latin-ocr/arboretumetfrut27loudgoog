Varieties. These are numerous, but the priucipal one, P. (a.) canescens,
being generally considered as a species, we shall first give it as such3
and next enumerate the varieties which belong to it and to P. alba.

δρας. Char„ ᾄσ. Leaves roundish, deeply waved, toothed3 hoary and downy
beneath. Catkins of the female plant cylindrical. Stigmas 8. (Smitk in
Eng. Fl.) It is essentially distin ished from P. alba, as ΜΓ. Crowe first
discovered, by the stigmas, whic are 8, spreading in two opposite di-
rections. The bracteas of the fertile flowers are, also, more deeply and re-
gularly cut. The branches are more u right and compact. The leaves are
rounder, more conspicuously 3-ribbe‹l', and less deeply or acutely lobed.
They are downy beneath ς but the down is chiefly greyish, and not so white
or cottony as in P. albat in some instances the leaves are glabrous.
(Smilla.) Smith has described the root as creeping as extensive} as that of
P. alba. P. canescens is found wild in “ wet ground in En land, grance, and
Germany3 sometimes also on open elevated spots, where t e soil is loamy.”
§Smilla in Rees’s Cycl.) It grows to about the same height as Ρ. alba, and
owers in March. “ Mr. Crowe was very instrumental in bringing this tree
into notice in Norfolk. He observed it to be of slower owth than P.
alba. The wood, though till lately it was but little used or istinguished, is
much firmer than that of any other British poplar; making as Βῗοοᾱ floors
