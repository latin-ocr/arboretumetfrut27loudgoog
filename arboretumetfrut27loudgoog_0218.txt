of willow baris, when dried and pulverised, to yield loz. of salicine. (Ibid.)
The wood of the willow is soft, smooth, and light: that of the salix caprea
is heavier than that of any other species of the genus, weighing‚ when dry,
41 lb. 6 oz. per cubic foot, and losing a twelfth part of its bulk in drying ; that of
Salix alba weighs 27 lb. 6 oz. per cubic foot when dry, and loses, in drying, some-
what more than a sixtb part of its bulk. In Pliny's time, willow wood was in re-
uest for the fabrication of shields, on account of its lightness ; and in the present

ooth-cutters, and other mechanics. It is in demand for turnery, and for shoes,
shoemakers’ lasts, and toys; for dyeing black, in imitation of ebony, as it takes
a fine polish; and sor a great variety of minor purposes. The wood of the
larger trees, such as S. alba and S. Russellicina, is sawn into boards for floor-
ing, aud sometimes for rafters3 in which last situation, when ke t dry and
ventilated, it has been known to last upwards of a century. he straight
stems of young trees, when split in tWO, make excellent styles for field ladders,
on account of their lightness. The boards are well adapted for lining waggons
and carta, particularly such as' are intended for coals or stoneS, or any hard ma-
terial, as willow wood, like other soft woodS, is by no means liable to splinter
· from the blow of any hard angular material. It is also valued for the boards
of the paddles of steam-vesseIS, and for the strouds of water-wheels, as it
wears in water better than any other kind of wood. The red-wood willow,
or stag’s-head osier (S. fragilis),according to Mathew, produces timber superior
to that of S. alba, or of any other tree willow. Itis much used in Scotland
for building small vessels; and especially for fast-§ailing sloops of war, by
reason of its lightness, pliancy, elasticity, and toughness. The wood, when
dry, is easily known from that of all other willowS, by its bei of a salmon
colour ς 011 which account it is sometimes used in cabinet-mraglting and· for
children’s toyS. “ Formerly‚'' says Mathew, “ before the introduction of που
hoops for cart wheeIS, the external rim, or fessoe, was made of this willow3 and,
when new, the cart or wain was drawn alon a road covered with hard smallgravel
(and, in preference, gravel somewhat angu ar) ς by which means the felloe shod
itself with stone, and thus became capable of enduring the friction of the road
for a long time, the toughness and elasticity of the willow retaining the gravei
till the stone was worn away. Under much exposure to blows and friction,
this willow ontlasts every other home timber. When recently cut, the ma-
tured wood is slightl reddish, and the sap-wood white. When exposed to
the air, and gradua ly dried, both are of salmon colour, and scarcely dis-
tinguishable from each other.’' (On Nau. Timb„ p. 63. S. Russellidna being
very nearl allied to S. fragilis, its wood has, pro ly, the same charac-
teristica. he longer shoots and branches of the tree willows are made into
poles for fencing, hep-poles, props for vineS, and other purposes3 and, when
forked at one end, into props for sup orting lines for clothes. They are also
much used for the handles of hay-r es, and other light agricultural imple-
ments 3 and they are split‚ and made into hurdleS, crates, and hampers ς and,
when interwoven with the smaller branches, into racks, or cradles‚10r the hay
and straw given to cattle in the fields, or in feeding·yards. The smaller rods,
with or without the bark on, are manufactnred into various kinds of baskets,
for domestic use3 and,split up into two, four, or more pieces‚ for making
lighter and ornamenta! articles, such as work-basketS, ladiae’ reticules, Sto.
lt is a remarkable fiact, that basket-making was one of the few manufactures
in which the ancient Britons excelled in the times of the Romans. These
baskets, or bascaudae, as they are called by Mastial, are said to have been of
very ele t workmanship, and to have borne a high price. (See Encyc. Brit..
