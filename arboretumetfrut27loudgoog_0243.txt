stances of the leuve& the number of sta-mens, and whether the planta are trees,
shrube, or ereepers. With due deference to the opinion thus e cased by
the great father of scientific botany, we think that the study of ὥνια, or of
any other species os plant, in its native habitat is by no means ἔξω mode
for determining what are species, and what are vanetiee3 but er likely,
on account of the great differ-enee of habitnts, to increase the number of bothg
since every difference may be considered specific relatively to the circumstances
which produce that difference. lt to us that it would be a better
mode to collect planta of the part‘ genus to be studied from all the dif-
ferent habitats in which they are to be found, and ιο cultivate and study them
in the same en, where they would be all subjected to the same exterior
influences. hat Sir J. E. Smith says on this subject does not appear to us
much more satisfactory than the advice of Linnaeus. “ Ψῦιοννε,’ he says,
“ should be particularly studied at three different seasons: the flowering time3
the early part of summer, when the young shoots, with their stipules and ex-
pandin foliage, are to be observed3 and, finally, when the leaves are come to
their fugll size. No botarust, therefore, can be competent to form an opinion
about them, unless he recides among the wild ones, for several seasons, or
continually observes them in „a garden. No hasty traveller over a country,
no collector of dried s cimens, or compilet of descriptions, can judge of their
characters or essen ' differences. One principle, above all, in this depart-
ment of botany, and indeed in every other, cannot be too strictly enforced.
We should study a species before we decide on its characters, and not lay
down rules of defimtiqn beforehand. · ln many planta, the differences of

tinction at all. n some tribes or genera, one part affords the best specific
character, in others some different part. The distinctions of willows are fre-
quently so very nice, that the greatest observation and experience only cen
staunp them with due authority.” (Eng. FL, iv. p. 165.) After thirty years’
study of every kind of willow that could be procured in any part of Britain,
in the garden of Mr. Crowe, where seedlings innumerable sprang up all over
the ground, Sir J. E. Smith was not only confirmed in the immutability of
his species, amounting to 64, as natives of Britain, but also, thet new or
hybrid species were not produced b the seeds of species growing together in
the same garden. Both these co usions are alike at vanance with thone of
most other botaniste. As the result of this eminent botarust’s study of the
genus, he has arra ed his 64- species of British willows under three sections,
characterised by t e margins and sursaces of the leaves3 viz. 1. serrated and
smooth ς 2. entire and smooth3 and, 3. surface shaggy, woolly, or silky. Since
the time of Sir J. E. smith, the principel British student of willows ie Mt.

sidered as chiefly species, or chiefly varieties3 and to us it the best
adapted sor the present state of our knowledge of willows, ' all the known
kinds shall have been studied for a number of years in one gardan.

Among the Continental botanists, the late Dr. Host of Vienna, and Pro-
fessor Koch of Erlangen, pear to be the principa! studente of willows.
Dr. Host, in the preface ιοἚιε Soli-r, seems disposed to consider the kinds of
willow that exhibit the same appearances when under the seme circumstances
of soil and situation as distinct spoeies3 and he has described no fewer than
60 of these as natives of Austria. He admits the extreme difficulty of de-
