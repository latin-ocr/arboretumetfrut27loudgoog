is eonsiderd unwholesome, and even dangeroua, to those who are long
exposed to it. In the Gard. Mag„ vol. ix. p. 586.. Mr. Godsall, nurnery-
man, of Heresord, mentions that he has seen the pavement of an arbour
over which a plant of Periploca grae'ca was trained, and in full flower,
literally covered with dead house-flles, which appeared to have fallen from
the blossotnS, apparently killed by some deletenouss property contained in
them. The capability of extenmon of this plant ia proved by one m the
Cambridge Botanic Garden having been trained, by meana of a jack chain,
as high aa the branchos of one of the trees of Sopadra ‘apbniczg mentioned
in p. 565. as being 50 st. high, and which was clear of ranchea to a con-
siderable height. When twined round a tree‚ the periploea forms a deep
identation in the bark. ( See Mag. Nat. Hist„ vol. vi. . 331.) Price of
plante, in the London nurseries, le. ad. eachz at Bollwy er, 60 centn and
at New York, 373 centa.
