in May. Introduced as B. n in 1736, by eter Collinson3 and again,
as B. angulata, in 1817, by essrs. Loddiges. We have ado ted the s e-
cific name of nigra, because it was preferred by Willdenow an Pursh. he
figure in Michaux, of which our fig.l562. is a correct co y, differs so much
from that given in Dend. Brit. ( our fig.l563), which we now to be a faith-
ful imitation of the plant which we intend to describe, as it is to be seen at
Messrs. Loddiges’s, and in various other numerica, that we are inclined to
think there must be some error in the application of the name to the figure
in Michaux3 though his description agrees perfectly with our plant — the
difference between the cuts being in the position of the catkins.

Virginis and North Carolina. The trunk and the largest limbs are covered
with a thick, deeply fiirrowed, greenish bark; but, on trees with trunks not
exceeding Sin. or 10 in. in diameter, the epidermis is
reddish, or of a cinnamon colour; “ whence, probably,’'
says Michaux, “ the appropriate denomination of red
birch. The idermis of this species, like that of the
eanoe birch B. papyraceo), divides itself transversely
into thin transparent sheets, which a pear to be com-
