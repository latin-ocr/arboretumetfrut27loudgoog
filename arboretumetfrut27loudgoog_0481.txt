1118 'st of rophecy ς 8ηά the sacred oaks, not only spoke and delivered oracles
w ' e in a 'ving state, but, when some of them were cut down to build the
ship Argo the beams and mast of that sbi fr uently spoke, and warned
the Argonauta of approaching calamities. ( om. Odys„ xiv.; Lucan, vi.
4223 Apoll„ book 1., 810.) After giving the account above related, Herodotus
adds what he calls the explanation of it. He says that some Phoe‘nician
merchants carried off an Egyptian priestess from Thebes into Greece, where
she took up her residence 18 1118 Forest of Dodona, and erected there, at the
foot of an old oak, a small temple in honour of Jufiter, whose priestess 8118
had been at Thebes. The town and temple of Do ona are said by others to
have been built by Deucalion, immediately aster the great flood, when, in ti·
tude for his preservation, he raised a temple to Jupiter, and consecra the
oak ove to his honour. This grove, or rather forest, extended from Dodona
to cffaonia, a mountainous district of Epirus, so called from Chaon, son of
Priam, who was accidentally killed there by his brother Helenus. The forest
was, from this, sometimes called the Chaonian Forest ; and Jupiter, Chaonian
father. (See Vir-gil, Ovid, &c.) The oracle of Dodona was not only the most
celebrated, but the richest, in Greece, from the offerings made b those who came
to it, to enquire into futurity. The propheciae were first de ivered by doves,
which were always kept in the temple, 18 memory of the fabulous origin assigned
to the oracle : but, asterwards,the answers were delivered by the priestesses3 or,
according to Suidas‚ Homer, and others, by the oaks themselves; hollow trees,
no doubt, being chosen, in which a priest might conceal himself. During the
Thracian war, a d utation of Boeotians consulting the oracle, the riestess
told them that, “i they would meet with success, they must be guifty osan
impious action ε ” when, in order to fulfil the oracle, they seized her, and
burnt her alive. After this, the Dodonian oracles were always delivered to
the Boeotians by men. The oracular powers of the Dodonian 08118 818 fre·
