Stigmas ovate, obtuse, notched, very short, nearly sessile. (Eng. Fa, iv,
p. 189.) A native of England, flowerin in March and A ril. This species is of
the size and habit of the last, but very istinct from it at rst sight, articularly
in the tendet summits of the young growing branches, which, wi their pur-
plish glaucone hue, and some degree of downiness, resemble those of a honey-
suckle. Catkins not more than half the size of those of S. Helix, with rounded,
blackish, bairy scales. Sm. Eng. Fl. First discovered on the banks of the
Willey‚ at Boyton, ilts, by A. . Lambert, Esq., whom the specific
name is meant to compliment. It grows in North America, on the banks
of rivers and willow grounds. It was introduced from Europe, and is cul-
tivated for basket-making. (Pur-sk.) S. Lambertidna is suitable for in-
troducin into ornamental plantations, from the gracesul character of its
slender s oots, and its glaucone foliage. There are-plante in the Hackney

and Goldworth arboretums, and also at Woburn, Flitwick, and Henfield.

men l. Ovary ovate, very pubescent, sessile, downy. γ tigmas nearly
sessile, ovate, scarcely emarginate. (Hook. Brit. Fl.. p. 41¹7.) A native of
England, about Lewes, Sussex, in omer holts, but scarcely walch at spngs-
ton upon Thammes, apparently wild3 flowering in May. In the sahctum
at Woburn, this species had not attained the h ht of 6 st. in live years. It
is considered to be very distinct from either . Helix or S. Lambertn'clna.
Mr. Borrer applied the specific name in complimeut to the late Mr.Wooll-
gar, ‘⁶ a gentleman who supplied Sir J. E. Smnth with several of his willows„
and who formed his opinions upon the species from lon and accurate obser-
vation.'’ (Hoolc. Br. FL, ed. 3.) S. Woollgaridna had ong been known to
Mr. Borrer and Mr.Woollgar as a variety of S. monandra Hoffm.3 but Mr.
Woollgar was so far of opinion that it was a distinct species, that he used
to call it S. cuneifolia, from the sha e of its leaves, especially the upper
ones, (md.) There are plante at enfield, and in the Goldworth Arbo-

Eetum3 and some, with the name of S. monandra, in that of Messa. Lod-
rges.
