sides those raised at home‚'' says
M‘Culloch, “ we import nuts from
different parts of Preme, Portugal, 1
and Spain, but principally from the ¹
latter. The Spanish nuts in the
highest estimation‚ though sold under
the name of Barcelona nuts, are not
really shipped at that city, but at
ona, a little more to the south.
Mr. Inglis says that the annual average
export of nuts from Tan-agona is

from 25,ooo to 3o‚ooo baga, of four
bags to the ton. The cost- was, free

The entries of nuts for home con-
sumption amount to from 100‚ooo to
125‚000 bushels a year; the duty of

indigenous woods‚ is meagre, and dro s off suddenly3 while the leaves of the
ash and the chestnut drop off early, wiien the have scarcely changed colour3
and, hence, these trees, as undergrowths, are ar inferior to the hazel in woods
which form conspicuous features in the view from a mansion, or where orna-
