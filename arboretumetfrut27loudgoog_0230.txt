with a little further, when two or more secondary ribs are introduced3 and
this process is continued till a sufficient number of subordinate ribs are put
in to support the wattling of the entire structure. For coarse baskets,
wattled with rods having the bark on, the distance of 3in. or 4in. between
the subordinate ribs, at the widest part, will be sufficient; but sor baskets
made of peeled rods, even of the largest size, 4in. are rather too much.
When the form of the basket is a square or a parallelogram, exactly the same

the rods which are to form the main ribs, and also those sor the secondary
riba, are split up the niiddle3 and, to render it easier to bend them, they are
steeped sor some hours in cold water. The rods intended for the subordinate
ribs are sometimes split into four parts; and, in bending both the main and
the subordinate ribs, the pith is alwa s ke t inwardS, so that the outer side
resents a smooth sursace. When t e ro s are to be split in two, a common
nise is made use of ς but when they are to be split into three or more
a piece of hard wood, 7 in. or 8 in. long, and about l in. in diameter, and cut
so as to present three or four sharp edges radiating from its centre, called
acleaver, is made use of. The knife bein entered at the thick end os the rod,
so as to split it into three or four parts or the length of l in„ the split part is
entered on the cleaver‚ and drawn against it till the whole rod is split from
one end to the other. This process is more simple, rapid, and easy in the
execution, than in the description.

according to this mode, two ribs, or largerlivands, sil-’e laid on the figor, cross-
ing each other at right a „lesz and one or two small wanda are woven round
them, as a nucleus in w ich to insert the end os other ribs. These ribs,

· itisevident, may be increased in number, and extended in direction, at plea-

sure, so as either to make the bottom of the basket circular, oval, or right-
angled. When the work is completed as far as the sides, the ribs are
turned upwards, and the work continued in a perpendicular direction as hi h
as required3 when a horizonta! rod, or rim, can be introduced, and m e

The English mode of balcet-making, which is in many res ets easier than
the Scotch and German mode, is effected by means of wil ow rods of one
year’s growth alone; whereas the Scotch mode requires the addition os rods
of two years’ wth sor the handles, rims, and ribs; and, in the ease of all
baskets mten ed to be tolerably strong, of rods, for these urposes‚of a tongh
and more durable kind of wood, such as ash, oak, hazel, aec. By the English
mode, the worltman begins on the floor, on which he lays two, three, or more
rods, but commonly three, parallel to and touching each o‘ther, and cut to the
length of the diameter of the bottom of the basket. On these three rods are
placed other three, parallel to and touching each other at right angles, cut also

As he proceeds with his interweavmg, he frequently turns round the skeleton
bottom, under· his foot, spreading out the rods which form the ribs, so that
their extr-emittes, after two or three courses of wands have been woven in,
are at equal distances from each other in the circumference of what is to form
the bottom of the basket, like the spolies of a wheel. The wearing being
carried on to the full extent of the bottom, the latter is now turned upside
down, and, the points of the radiating ribs being cut off, a willow rod is inserted
