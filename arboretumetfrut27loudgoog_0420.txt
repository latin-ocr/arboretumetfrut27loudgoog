lanted in France, Belgium, and Germany. Every traveller in Prussia must

Kewemis, it was introduced into England about 1758, by the Earl of Roch-
ford, from Tutin, where he was ambassador3 and he planted it at St. Osyth’s,
in Essex, in which county this poplar is said still to go by his name. Dr.
Walker states that cuttings of the Lombardy poplar were first brought to
London by the Earl of Hertford, in the ear 17633 and, according to others,

1761. (S’ee p. 57.) cuttings from the trees raised by Lord 1'1erts0rd were
sent to New Posso, in Tweeddale, in 17653 and the tree was also extensively
distributed in scotland, some years afterwards, b Lord Gardenstone, who
brought the cuttings direct from Italy (See, his {havelberg Menwrandums.)
The tree has since been generally planted throughout Europe, chiefly as an
avenue, or roadside, tree3 or as an ornamental tree among houses in towns 3

Properties and Usee. The wood, according to Manem, is inferior to that of P.

nigra3 but it will do ver well for packing-cases. The brancheS, he adds, are
of very little use either or fuel or vine-props3 and, in consequence, its culture
as a useful tree in Lombardyis now ver generally abandoned in favour of that of
P. nigra. (Gard.Mag., vol. xii. p. 570. When Arthur Youn travelled in Italy,
he found that the Lombardy poplar grew to the height of 405 in 8 years 3 and
that in 12 years it was fit to cut down for building purposes. Rasters, small
beams, stude, boards, dcc„ brushed over with coal tar and brick-dust, laid on
hot, have stood sixteen years without the least decay. In twenty years, he
sayn, the tree will produce a trunk 2 ft. in diameter, which, being cut down, is
