reason, if the size of the rind is to be any criterion of
age, why the Winfarthing should not, at least, equal the
Bentley Oak3 and, if so, it would be upwards of 700
years old at the Conquest ς an age which might very well ’

justify its then title of the ‘Old Oak! It is now a mere eheu—a mi nty
ruin, blcached to a snowy white; but it is magnificent in its decay: and do
wonder much that Mr. Strutt should have omitted it in his otherwise satis-
factory list of tree worthies. The only mark of vitality it exhibita is on the
south side, where a nan-ow strip ofbark sends forth the few branches shown
in the drawi , which even now occasionally produce acorns. Itis said to
