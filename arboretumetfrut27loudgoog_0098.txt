Cuttings of from 4in. to 6 insin length should beyput in, in autumn, in a
sandy soil, and a shaded situation, and m a year they will be fit to transplant
into nursery lines. Layers may be made either in the spring or autumn, and
either of the youngor old wood. The dwarf box used for edgings is propa-
gated by being taken up, divided, and replanted. The roots of the box, bemg
numerous an small, though by no means hair-like, like those of the Eri «-
ceae, retain the earth about them; so that plants of box always come up with
a ball; and hence the tree may be transplanted at almost any season, provided,
is in summer, that the weather be motst at the time. Box edgings are best
lanted early in spring, because the frost in winter is apt to destroy those
'‘eavae which have been cut in trimming the plants. Box edgings and hedges
may be clipped at almost any season, except midwinter. Some en
ers prefer trimming box edgings in June, just when the plants have near y com-
pleted their year’s 'shoots 3 because they will afterwards make shoots of

ractice is fo’llowed, it is neegspsgry to go over the edgings or hedges in July,
n order to cut neatly off with the knife mlv shoots that may have been pro-
truded too fal-3 taking care not to cut the eaves. The more common prac-
tice is to cl' the box in autumn 3 but in that case, as many of the leaves are
injured by t e shears, their marks remain till the middle of the following May.
The edging or hedge looks well for a fortnight at that seasong but afterwards ιι
has rather a neglected appearance, till the next trimmin season, which isin the
beginning of September. The superiority of the June c i ping must be obvious,
whether applied to edgings, hedges, or mural or s pturesque ornaments.
Box edgi , when kept low, if they are wanted to endure many year-a, require
occasiona‘ff} to be cut in almost to the ground3 and this operation should only'
be performed on one side of the edging in one year, and not on the other side
till the second year following. When treated in this way, both “ and
h es will, on good loamy soil, last an extraordinary length of time; w ereas,

formed there, which, y exeludmg the an· from the stem within, occasions the
decay of the weakestg and the edging or hedge becomes naked belovv, and
unsightly. Sometimes· this evil may be remedied by cutting downg but-in

to enclose the tres in a slight frame of wirework of the form pro sed: the
