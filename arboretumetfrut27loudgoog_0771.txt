of North America. Introduced in 1812. The American hornbeam is
smaller than that os Europe3 as, though under
peculim-l favourable circumstances it sometimes
'attalus t e height of 25st. or 30 st„ these instances

, are of rare occurrence, and its ordinary stature is
that of a large shrub. The trunk is rather thick
in roportion to its height, and frequently obliquely
an irregularly fluted. The branches are numerous,
short, and thlckly set, so as to give the whole tree
a dwarfish and stunted pearance. The burk is
smooth, and spotted wit white. The leaves are „40
oval, acuminated, and finely dentated. The female ἑά ’ ⁴ Ὗ
flowers are collected in long, loose, pendulous cat- ¹ ν
kins, like those of the European hornbenmg and,
like that ἀ, the bracteas ex and, with the ro·

s of t e fruit, into a kind olP leaf, furnich at

e base with a small, hard, oval nut. The eatkins
often remain attached to the trec after the leaves
have fallen. The trec grospers, in North Ameria,
in almost every soil an situation: it is found, ac-
cording to Michaux, as far north as the provinces
of Nova Scotia3 and, according to Pursh, as far
south as Florida. The wood is white, and exceed·

cannot be procured.” (N. Amer. Syl„ ni. p. 29.) It was introduced by
Pursh, in 1812 3 and there are plante of it in some of the London nurseries.

It is propagated by layers, and sometimes by imported seeds.
