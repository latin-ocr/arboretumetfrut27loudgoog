in a hairy or cottony covering3 in consequence of which,
they are wasted to a great distance by the wind. The
growth of all the varieties is extremely rapid3 so that a Q

Garden. As a proof of the rapidity of the growth of
the abele tree, Evelyn mentions one of these trees at
Syon, “ which, being lopped in February, 1651, did, by
the end of October, 1652, produce branches as big as 1503
a man³s wrist, and 17 ft. in height.” Truncheons of the white poplar, 9st.
long, planted on the banks of a stream, some yards from the current, had, in
12 years, trunks nearl loin. in diameter3 and had heads in proportion. (Bam
Soc. Papers, 1786, vo . iii. p. 90.) The duration of the tree rarely exceeds

soils, ’ns to decay.y Mitcghell says that, on the banks of riggo, the tree is
at its value in 40 or 50 years; but that, in dry situations, it will require
from 50 to 70 years to mature it. (Dendrotogia, δια, p. 51. In the Didionnaire
dee Emu- et For-ete, it is stated, that a tree planted in a eld, and surrounded
by a fence at 25 ft. distance from it on every side, formed by its suelters,in-
20 years, a eirmln· clump of wood 50 st. in diameter3 and, consequently,
that 30 οι· 40 trees would cover an acre with a thick wood in the same space
of time. Hence it follows, that, when the tres is once introduced into woods,
especially where the soil is loamy and moist, it forms a perpetual succession
of young trees, however frequently these may becut down. When treated
as co pice-wood, the abele is by no means a durable plath the stools decay-

(ἔασεν-φήῃ. The common grey poplar (P. (a canescens is generally sup-
posed to be a native of Britain, as well as of rance and ermany3 but the
abele tree (P. elba) is thou t b some to have been first brought to England
from Flanders. This we ink ighly probable; and it is favourable to our
, opinion that· P. elba and its varieties ought to be considered· as cultivated
forms of P. canescens. P. elba and P. (a·) canescens are indigenous to Euro e,
as far north as 56⁰ or 57⁰3 and they are found throughout the south of ‘u-

trees in the Island of Lewis. Whether these trees in Lewis belong to P. elba,
or P. (a.) canescens, may, however, be doubted. Turner, in 1568, says, “the
white aspe is plentifull in Germany and Italy;” but that he does not remember
to have seen it in E land. Gerard, who wrote 30 years aster Turner, found ·
the white poplar at B kwall, near London3 at Ovende11, in Essexg and a few·
other places. Dr. Walker, writing in 1773, says that it is doubtful whether
the abele is a native of England3 but that it certainly has the appearance of?
being indigenous in several parts of Scotland. · But it must be recollected
that, in his time, P. elba and P. (a.) canescens were considered as synonymous.
He adds, also, that the abele was planted iu many places in Scotland about the
end of the seventeenth century3 and that it had been afterwards neglected and
despised, in consequence of the great number of suckers that it threw up all round
it from its cr ing roots. Han-tub, in his Compleat Husbandman (published in
1659), states t t, some years before the time of his mining, there were 10,000
