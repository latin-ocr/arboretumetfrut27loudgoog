As an ornamental tree, Sang oboerves, “the Scotch elm cannot be termed
beautifu13 but, certain] , an aged elm, when standing singly, is 8 very ca ⁸
object. Iu the form oeits branches,and its geneml outline,1t much resem les
the oak. Hence, in many of the recently improved places in Scotland
(where this tree chiefly abounds ‚ it has been reserved as an ornamental trec,
and, in this particular, ιε an ex lent substitute for the oak. Even where the
oak and the chestnut abound as at Alva ,the Scotch elm maintains its place,
with excellent effect, as a tree.'' Sang'e Pl. Cal„ p. 86.) Gilpin says
of thesswych clm, that it ‘⁴ is, perhaps, generally more picturesque than the com-
mon sort, as it hangs more neg 'gently, though, at the same time, with this
negligence, it loses in a good degree that happzvsurface for catchin messes of
light which we admire in the common elm. e observo, also, w en we see
this tree in company with the common clm, that its bark is somewhat of a
lighter hue. The wych elm is a native of Scotland, where it is found, not
only in the plains and valleys of the Lowlands, but is hardy enough to climb
the steeps, and flourish in the remotest Highlands3 though ιι does not attain,
in those climata, the size which it attains in England. Naturalists suppose
the wych elm to be the only species of this tree which is indigenous to our
island.'’ (Gilphu's For-eet Secum-y, vol. i. p. 44.) On this passage, Sir Thomas
Dick Lauder observes, “ We are disposed to think that Mr. Gilpin hardly
does justice to this elm. For our parts, ve consider the wych, or Scottish,
clm as one of the most beautiful trees in our British sylva. The trunk is
so bold aud picturesque in form, covered, as it frequently is, with huge ex-
crescences ς the limbs and branches are so free and pacesul ιιι their growth3 and
the foliage is so rich, without bein leafy or clumpy as a whole3 and the head
is, generally, so finely massed, an yet so well broken, as to render it one os
the noblest of ark trees ς and, when it grows wildly amid the rocky sceuery
of its native Speotland, there is no tree which assumes so great or so
pleasing a variety of character.” (Lauda-’s Gilpin, i. p. 91.) One of the
most common uses of this trec, in British nursenes, is as a stock for the dif-
ferent sorta of English and American elms.

Popular superstitious. In man parts of the country, the wych elm, or
witch hazel, as it is still occasional y called, is considered 8 ative against
witches3 probably from the coincidence between the νοι- s wych and witch.
In some of the midland cenatica, even to the resent day, 8 little cavity is
made in the churn, to receive a small portion olP witch hazel, without which
the dairy-maids imagine that they would not be able ιο get the butter to
come.

Soil and situation. “ The Scotch elm,” Sang observes, ‘⁸ accommodate·
itself, both in a natural state and when planted, to many different soils and
situations. The soil in which it most luxuriatae is 8 deep rich loam ς but that in
which it becomes most valuable‚ is 8 sandy loam, lying on rubble stone,or on dry
rock. It is frequently found flourishing by the sides of rivers or streams,
which sometimes wash art of its roots; yet it will not endure s ant
moisture. In πει tilly c ys, as at Panmure in Forfarshire, it soon sic ens.
On bleak hills, among rocks, and where soil is hardly perceptible, its roots
will osten find nourishment, and the tree will arrive at 8 considerable size.
In a mixture of loarn and clay schisma, incumbent on whinstone rock, as at
Alva, it arrives ata large size within 8 century.” (Plani. Cal„ p. 56.) ·

Propagation and Czdture. The Scotch elm does not produce suckers like
the English elm; but, according to Boutcher, it roots more readily from layers
than that species. The most ready mode of prapagating it, however, js by
seeds, which are produced in great abundance, an are ripe about the middle
