Plantas-um, 82 ς and about the same number are described in the Nouveau
Du Hamel, and by Smith in the article Quercus in Rees’s Cychpoedia. Ac-
cording to the Dictionnaire Clam‘que d’Ht'stm'w Natiwelle, the total number of
species described by botanists up to 1823 was 1303 of which one half belonged
to America, and of these upwards of 40 to the United States. Humbo dt
and Bonpland collected 24 species in Mexico; Dr. Wallich and Dr. Royle
have found nearly half that numberin the temperate regions of India3 and
Blume found 16 s ecies in Java. If, therefore, we take the number of oaks
which have been escribed by botanists at 150, we shall probably not be far
from the truth. Of these, the number indigenous to, or introduced into,
Britain is, according to our Hortus Britannicus, 623 so that there remain
'to be introduced nearly 100 sorts. When it is considered that all the oak
family are decidedl trees of tem rate regions, and would probably all live
in the open air in t e climate of ondon, their introduction seems one of
the most desii-able objects of arborieultural exertion.

The economioal History of the European oaks may date from the days of
Theophrastus and Pliny ; the importance of the genus, and the various uses to
which the different species are ap lied, havi been treated of in every work on
plantin or forest culture since e time of t e Greek naturalist. Secondat,
in his ἐπι. sur effac. Nat. da chem, published in 1785, was the first writer
who showed the different qualities of the wood of Q. pedunculata, Q. sessili-
flora, and Q. Tanizia ‚- he also made various experimenta to ascertain the

both professura, and members of the Academia Royale des Sciences, first
pointed out the common error in considering the wood of Q. sessiliflora, which
is common in the old ecclesiastical buildings in France, as the chestnut. (See
Mem. de moad. des Scien. for 1781, p. 4-9. and . 295. The first work on
the American oaks which treated of the uses of the timber was‘that of the
elder Michaux, entitled Histoire des Chenes de PAmen'que, published in 1801 ;
and the best modern account of them is in the North American Sylva of his
son, in 3 volumes‚ 8vo, the English edition of which was published in 1819.
Bosc has also published what may be called the po ular and economical history
of the oak, which is entitled, Memoires sur les :ffbrentes Espeees de Cbe‘ne

National de France, 1³· Seme-stre, for 1807, p. 307. In this work 50 species
are described, of which 14 are considered natives of France. The Becher-ekes
Hister-iqua sur les Chanes, and the Eum· sur les Hoemmzies Ve‘getales et
Avernales du Chene, both by Marquis, contain some curious information on
the subject. The elder Michaux’s work has been translated, and some
additions made to it, by Dr. Wade, in his Quercus, published in 1809. It is
remarkable, that, in Martyn's edition of Miller’s Dic-tionum, the part of which
treating of Quercus was published in 1807, no notice whatever is taken of
the osss of America, except those which had been described in the Hortus
Kewensis, tho Michaux's Histoire cles ΟΙιέηεε, 810„ was published six years
before. The moenitates ρων-οἱπερ, b the late Professor Burnet, published
in Nos. 5. and 6. of B ’s Eidodemgvn, 1833, and which occupies 25 folios
of the immense o that work, is one of the latest essays on the subject,
and, like all wor s that have been written by that learned author, is a very curi·
ous and elaborate production, though not so well known as it deserves to be.
