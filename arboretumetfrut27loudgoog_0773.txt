obtuse. ( mua.) A tree, from aeft. to 40 st. in height; a native of Italy

and the south os Euro . It was introduced into England before 1724,

as it iz mentioned in urber’s Numen-y catalogue, publiahed in that year.

The hop bornheim, in its general appearance,

bark, brancha, and foliage, bears a great re-

semblance ιο the common bornheam3 but is

regularly imbncated‚ ιο aa to form a cylindrical

atrobile, very like the catkin of the female

hop3 whereas in the common hombeam the

bracteas are and spreading. The tree

hasavery han me appearance when in fruit3

and, in favourabie eiuratione, it will attain

nearly aa large a aize aa the common horn·

on tbe common hornbeam3 but, aa the growth of the former ιε more

rapid than that of the latter, unloea the grast ia made immediately above

the oollar, the trunk of the scion becomes too large for that of the noch,

and the tree is liable to be blown down, οι· broken over by the wind.

Propagating by layera, or by seoda, ia therefore a preferable mode.
