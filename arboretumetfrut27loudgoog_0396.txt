from which it will be im saible entirely to extricate them, till both the male
and female planta of eac sort have been cultivated together for a number of
years in the same garden. Judging from the planta in the London nurseriea,
and in the arboretuma of the Horticultural Society and Messra. LoddigeS, we
think that all the kinds now in actual cultivation in Britain may be included
under the heada of P. alba, P. tremula, P. nigra, and P. balsamifera.

Po lars, from their id growth and eat bulk, are liable to have their

poplara and wsslows in §witzorlanss where the pupa often remains two full
years, before it assumes the perfect state. (Ihm, v1ii. 558.) Populus grae*ca
affords food to this moth, to the poplar hawk moth (Smerinthus KopuIi), to
the kitten moth (Cei-ulra furcula), to the pebble prominent moth( otod6nta
ziczac),and'tofvarious species of Clostera, (the chocolate-ti d moths), which
seed exclusivel on the poplar and willow. The larva o ἕῗηθτίιιεὴιιε populi
(Mag. Nat. iet„ viii. 629.) is v common both on poplara and wlllowS,
' and osten strips them entirely of eir foliage3 the moth of this species ia
aeldom seen, aa it flies but little, and only during the night. The larva of
Smerinthua ocellatua is common on willows and poplars from July to the end
of September, and the fly does not usually appear till the following spring.
It is stated of this inaect, that a female produced young without havin any
connexion with the male3 from which ιι would appear that in certain {mpi-
d6ptera a single pmnng' ” can render fertile more than oue eration, aa well
aa in the case o the A'phides. (M . Nat. Hm„ viii. 55vfnTrochffium api-

which atta the poplar and the wil ow, will be found in the Magazine qt'
Natural History, vols. i. to ix. inclusive. Various epiphytieal fungi are found
on the poplar, some of them on the leaves, and others on the bark of the
brancha or trunk; auch as Sclerotium populinum Pers„ Erysiphe adunca

paedia quIanis, where several of the species are figured.
