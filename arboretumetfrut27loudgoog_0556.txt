there is little or no white wood.’' (p. 365.) The oak, Sang observes, ‘⁸ will
grow, and even become timber of considerable size, in soils of very opposite
natures. It thrives best, however, in strong deep loam, incumbent on gravei
or dry rock3 but in all soils in which there is any considerable proportion of
loamitwill thrive in a greater or lessdegree. Inlowsituations,wheretbe
soil is deep and meist, it grows rapidly, and attains a great size3 but in such
places it is found to decay sooner than it· does in a more elevated situation,
with a drier soil. In light soils of little de th, altho h it grows slowly, it
becomes firm in texture3 and the timber, ough sm er in size, acquires a
state of maturity sooner than that grown on more coo'l and retentive soils.
In deep cool saud, it will root firmly, and arrive nt a great size. In clay,
incumbent on till, to which all other trees, except the beech and the sycamore
have an aversion‚ the oak will grow and produce usefuhtimberss' (let. Kal„

cellent soil is certain, even by the token of this natural only. Thus, by
the plantation of this tres and some others, we have the vantage of profit

of the crust only.’' (Hune. EveL, p. 91.) In Hampshno, in that of the
New Forest called the Woodlands, wherever the oak tree clay, or y low wood-
land clay, exista, its presence is more or less indicated by a spontaneous grovth
of oak wood. “ In all such situations‚” Vancouver observes, “ this timber
may be cultivated to advantage3 but, where the natural soil of the oak taee

p . The reasons, lt is general y considered, notwithstandmg the opinions
of ichols and Monteath‚ above given, are to be found in the comparatively
slow growth of trees in dry soils fully exposed to the weather3 and to the
greater degree of pei-fection to which the timber of every tree must arrive,
when its leaves are exposed to the influence of the sun and sir on every side,
and from the summit of the tree to its base. Oaks, says Pliny, grown in
valleys are more stately, tall, and spreading, than those grown on mountains;
but the timber of the latter ia far better and finer-guinem and, con uentlv,
more durable. Mitchell is of o inion that the best oak for ship-bu ding is
produced from a ealeareous sos, in rather an upland simation, such as the
Sussex chalk. lgm„ p. 31.) Indeed, it is generally considered that the best
oak timber in ngland is produced in the county of Sussex. (See p. 614.) -
