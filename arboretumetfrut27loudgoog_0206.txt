nearly twice as large as that of the species3 8ηά having a white shell, with
rounded prominences instead of angles. A century of cultivation, he says,
would perhaps not advance the species generally to an ual degree of rfec-
tion with this accidental variety. Rg. 1270. represents t e Sphinx jug andis,
or Hickory Hawk Moth, which in Georgia is found on this tree. The cater-
pillar is smaller than that of most of the other species, and generally is of a
shaded red and yellow, though it is sometimes green. The perfect insecta are
brown, and resemble the English poplar hawk moth. The caterpillar buries
in the ground, and varies very much as to the time in continues there: one
observed by Abbott having gone into the ground in May, and reappeared in
June, and another having buried itself in September, and remained in the
ground till the following April. (Abbott and Smite't, Inseets qf Geor-gia.)

Desa-spaera. Michaux says, speaking generally of the scaly·bark hick-
ories, that “ they exhibit many striking traits of resemblance which may
warrant the grouping of them into a separate section. Besides their
generic and specific characters, they tploasess others peculiar to themselves,

the height of 80 st„ with an ample head, and a straight trunk. The bark is
divided into strips, or shreds, from lft. to 3st. long, the pieces of which,
when they are ready to scale off, are warped outwards at each end, and attached
onlyin the middle. When they sall, they are succeeded by others similarly
exposed. In this s ies, Michaux observes, the plates of bark are narrower,
more numerous, an of a lighter colour, than those of C. alba3 from which·
differences he tho ht it advisable to give it the specific name of laciniosa.
The leaves vary in ength from Sin. to 20 in., and are composed of from ’7 to
9 leaflets3 whereas in C. alba the shell-bark hicko , the leaflets are invari-
ably 5. The barren catkins are long, glabrous, fil· orm, and pendulous3 3
being united on a common petiole, attached to the basis of the young shoots.
The fertile ssowers appear, not very conspicuonsly, at the extremity of the
shoots of the same spring. They are succeeded by a large oval fruit, more ¹
than 2in. long, and 4 in. or 5in. in circumference. It has four depressed
