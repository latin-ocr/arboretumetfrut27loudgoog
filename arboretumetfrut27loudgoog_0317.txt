serrated, with half-heart-shaped stipules, strongly serr-sted, or toothed, vari-
ous in size, but never very large.” Accordin to Smith, S. cinerea is the least
usefnl of the sallows; but its branohes, w en two ears old, are used for

hands and coarse wickerwork. There are planta at oburn, Flitwick, 8ηά
in the Hackney arboretum.

Varietv‘es. There are several varieties of this species, one of which has va-
riegated leaves3 and, as this is a rare character among willows, it merits a

distinct notice. Smith, in his Issnglish Flora, iv.2p. 216.,notices having re- ·

eeived a specimen of such a variety from Germany. Mr. Forhes has since
found two planta with slightly vari leaves,growing in the Woburn
plantatione. He has figured some o these leaves, from which it pears
that they are blotched with small yellow blotches. Koch has reserr to S.
cinerea L„ as varieties, S. cinerea Sutia, S. aquatica smith, 8ηά S. oleifolia
