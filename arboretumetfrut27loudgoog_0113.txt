One great object that we have had ιιι vlew, m giving this article at such Ι ,
is, the promotion of silk culture in that interesting of the world.

the silk, like the tobacco and the wine, of παι-ιιι climates, and os r
dry soils, is always superior to that produced in colder climates, and ξω
rich and moist soils. The fruit of some os the varieties, particularly of M.
a. multicaulis, is used sor making robs end symps; and is said to be remark-
ably good to ent3 for which reason this variety, in wnrm climates, might be
introduced into orchards. The bark, according to Rosier, may be conver-ted
into linenofthefineneesofsilk. “Forthbpmtheywwm is ga·

the most important use of the white mulberry, however, is as food for the
silk-mothg and this subject we shall here notice under two hends3 viz. that
ps the management of the trees and leaves, snd the management of the
insecta.

Malla-ny Platorium. In India and Chius, these are made much in the‘
same manner as those of the sugat-eane, and other ⁶ ultural plsnts. A
fieldis laidoutintosquaresof5ft.or6ft. on the si eng and in thecentre
of each square a hollow is formed ς, the soil stirred and manured3 and five οι· ·
six mulberry cuttings inserted in a group in the centre. These lants are
never allowed to grow higher than Βῆ. or ⁴}st- 3 being cut down to e ground
ev year, in the same manner as s raspberry plantation. In the south
of urope‚ the white mulberry is grown in plantatione by itself, like willows
and fruit trees3 also in hedgerows, and as hedges3 but in all cases the plants
are kept low, for the convenience os gathering the leaves without injuring the
trees ς the greatest h ‘ ht they are suffered to attain beingthat of a pollard of
6 st„ which is annuali o ped. In Guernsey, and the nort of France, nnd also
in some parts of 1 y, t ο mulberry is chiefly g'rown as ⁸. hedgerow pollard, or

perfectly dry, aster the dew has disappeared ιιι the morning. The person
employed to gether them strips them off upwards, and deposits them in a
bag kept open with a hoop, and provided with a loop and strap to pass over
his shoulder. When the leaves are gathered, the trees must be stnpped en·
tirely of every least as this is found not to injure the tree half so much as if
only part of the leaves were taken off. ln American, the operation of stripping
off the leaves is often repeated a second time the same yenr; but, in France
and Italy, the tree is very rarely subjected to so severe a trial. When labour
is sufficiently chenp, the leaves are best cut off with a pair of scissors. After
the first stri ing, the white mulberry and all its varienes are very soon 'n
covered wi leaves ς and, if 4¹¹!OE leaves were removed at once, the tree oes
