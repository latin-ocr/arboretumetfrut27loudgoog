alread obser-ved that the chestnut, in Britain, is chiefly planted on the margins
of o ards, for the purpose of sheltering them. 1t is also occasionally planted
in hedgerows3 but, from the denuit of the head, the early appearance of the
foliage, and its long continuance ore it drops, the tree is mjurious both to
the hedge and to the grass below.

As em ornaments! Troe, Sang observes that many chestnuts should not be
planted near a residence ς because ‘⁴ the flowers eant a very power-ful and dis-

eeable odour, which is offensive to most people.” Gilpin considers the

This is the tree which graoes the lan of Salvator Rosa. In the moun-
tains of Calabria, where Salvator painted, the chestnut flourished. There he
studied it in all its forms, breaking and disposing it in a thousand beautiful
abspes, as the exigences of his composition required, 1 have heard, indeed,’'
continues Gilpin, “ that it is naturally brittle, and liable to be shattered b
windo, which might be one reason of Salvator's attachment to it3 but, althoug
1 have nrany times seen the chestnut‚ in England‚ old enough to be in a fruit-
bearing state, yet 1 have seldorn seen it in a state of full pictur-esque maturity.’'
(For. See-n.) Bosc says: “ As an ornamental tree, the chestuut ought to be
placed before the oak. Its beautiful leaves, which are never attacked by in-
secta, and which hang on the trees till very late in autumn, mass better than
those of the oak, and give more shade. An old chestnut, standing alone, pro-
duces a superb effect. Α grou of young chestnuts forms an excellent back·
und to other trees ; but a estam coppice is insu portably monotonous.”
Nous. Coun, dcc„ art. Chataignier.) In British parea, the chestnut is dis-
pla to most advantage when standing singly, or in scattered groups along
wit the oak ς and the gradation in the foliage and manner of tuftin formed by
Q. sessiliflora, between the chestnut and Q. pedunculata, forms a p easing har-
mony, interesting both in a botanical and a picturasque point of view. In hil ly
grounds, the allusion which· the chestnut creatas to the Apennines affords a
pleasing- argument for lanting ιι ιιι such mttmtions.

it attaius a large size, and in so short a time, that, accordi to Sang, wherever
the chestnut is planted in its proper soil and situation, it wil ou ow any other
tree in the same length of time, except, perhaps, the larch, t e willow, and
some of the poplars. According to Bosc, it will not thrive in calcareous soi13
but clayey and sand soils, and those lying over granite, gneiss, and schistus, and
which are compo of the debris of these rocks, appear particularly suitable for
it. It thrives well amon rocks where there is apparently very httle soil; in-
sinuating itself among their fissures and chinks, and attaining a large siae.
‘⁸ Wherever 1 have seen chestnut trees,’' observes the same author, “ and Ι
have seen them in a t many different localitieS, they were never in soils
or on surfaces fit for g? roduction of corn. On mountains in France, Swit-
zerland, and Ital , the οἳ]
climates suitable or corn, the trecis only found on rocky and flinty soils.” In
Britain, the tree will not attain any h ’ t, unless in sheltered situations, and
where the soil is free and of some dep ; but in poor gravelly soil, where its
roots will only run alon the surface, it will attain a very considerable dia-
meter of trunk, and be o great longevity, though its head may never be larger
than that of a pollard. Of this, the chestnut trees in Greenwich Park and
Kensington Gardens may be cited as proofs.

Propagation and Culture. The species is propagated by the nut, which may
be treated exactly in the same manner as the acorn3 and the varieties are
