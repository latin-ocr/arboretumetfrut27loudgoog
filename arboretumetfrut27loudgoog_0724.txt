For tlte pietamque Properties qs the Beeeh, we shall resort to our usual au-
thority,Gilpin. “After timber trees‚”this author observes, “the beech deserve-
our notice. Some, indeed, rank the beech among timber trees; but, 1 believe,
in general it does not find that respect, as its wood is ofa soft spo nature,

and projections, and has sometimes a sort of irregular- fluting about it, which
is very characteristic. It has another peculial-hy, also, which is sometimes
pleasing,-—that of a number of stems “ ’ from the root. The bark, too,
wears often a pleasing hue. 1t is naturally o a din olive3 but it is always
overspread, in patches, with a variety of mosses and 'chens, which are com-
monly of a lighter tint in the upper parts, and of a deep velvet green towards
the root. Its smoothness, also, contrasts agreeably with those rougher ap
dages. No bark tempts the lover so much to make it the depository his
mistress's name. It conveys a happy emblem :—‘ Crescent illan cresoetis
