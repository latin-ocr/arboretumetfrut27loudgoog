by far more imffirtant than that of any species of the genus, cork5 a substance
which is not produced by any other tree whatever, ι8 sufficient quantities to
be plied to any useful purpose.

T 8 leaves, the flowers‚ and the stuit, accordin to Bosc, afford nourish·
ment to more than 200 species of insecta, even in e neighbourhood of Paris ς
8ηά some of these insects are either valuable themselves in the arts, or they
are the cause of υκαι-88888888, 8880 88 081Ἑ8118, which are valnable. The
leaves of Q. coccifera afford nourishment to e coccus ssicis, a hemipterous
insect, which is used in medicine under the name of kermes, 8ηά 088 0888
employed in dyeing scarlet, from the remotest antiquity, under the name of
scarlet grain. This insect is produced, 8ηά cultivated sor commerce, in the
south of France, and in various parts of the south of Europe, and of the East.
Oak galls, which are much in demand for the manufacture of ink and for dyeing
black, are produced on most of the deciduous European species, and are very
abundant on the section Robur3 but the galls of commerce are chiefly pro-
duced by the Q. infectoria, 8 ¹native of Asia Minor and the adjoin‘ countries.
All the smaller parts of oaks, such as the spray, buds, leaves, owers, and
fruit, may be employed in tanning3 and, accordingly, the cups‚ or calyxes, of
some species are in use for this urpose, more particularly those of the valonia
oak (Q. AE'gilo 8), 8 native 0 the Archipelago. The leaves of the section
Robur are us as a substitute for spent tanner’s bark in hot-houses; and
being slow in decomposition, are found to retain the heat sor a longer period
than those of any other European trees.

The acorns of all the species are edible; and, in ev country where the
oak abounds, they form the most important of the ood of wild usdru-
peds of the fructivorous or omnivorous kin s, and of some birds. T ewild
animals most useful to man, which are nourished by them, both in Europe
8ηά Amet-ica, are the wild boar, the stag, 8ηά the goat. In Asia, pheasants
and p' ns, with other birds in awild state, eatacorns, no less than wild qua-
dru s. In North America, cows, horses, swine, bears, s uirrels, pigeons,
an wild turkeys devour them. Among the domestic anim s which eat 8ηά
thrive on acorns, the principal is the swine; but there are few animala and
birds, in a state of domestication, Bosc observes, that may not be made to
live and thrive on them, however unwilling they may be to touch them at
first. In the earlier ages, there ean be no doubt that acorna, in the countries
where they were produced, were the food of man ς 8ηά they are still, as we
have seen, eaten in some arts of the south of Eur , the north of Africa,
and the west of Asia. he kinds which produce e acorns most valued
for eating are, Q. I'lex, Q. Bausta, Q. ramuntia, and Q. E‘sculus. The degree
of bitterness in acorns, produced by t e same species, varies exceedingly on
different trees 3 8ηά were any kind of oak to be introduced into orchards as a

The entire tree or shrub, in the case of every s ies of oak, may be con·
sidered as highly ornamental: the least so are e willow-leaved oaks, and
the most so the lobed and deeply sinuated leaved kinds. The foliage, even,
of the same species, and more especially of the deciduous kinds, varies ex-
ceedingly3 not only on different individuals, but on the same individual at
different seasons of the year. In sp ⁶ ‚ the leaves of man of the decidu-
ous kinds are small, delicate, and beau ⁸ ully tinged with yel ow and red; in
summer, they are broad 8ηά greem and in autumn, coriaceous‚‘ and of 8
russet brown, scarlet, or blood-red colour. Nothing can be more remarkable
than the variation in the forms of the leaves, in the same individual, in some
of the American species: those os the tree, when young, being sometimes
