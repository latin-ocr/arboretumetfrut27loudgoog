Description, «3-0. Deciduous trees, natives of North America, and, though
several sorta have been described by botanists, probably all resemble to two,
or at most three, species: viz. N. biflora, N. candicans, and N. tomentosa, the
last two being very nearly allied. In the case of Nyssa,as in those of fflxinus
and Quercus, there are seeds of several alleged s ies procured from Amerim3
and though plants from these may come up wfgcably distinct, we do not eon-
sider that circumstance sufficient to constitute each sort a species. The trees
of this genus are of little use for their timber, but the fruit of N. candicans,
N. tomentosa, and Ν. denticulata, thered a little before maturity, and pre-
served with sugat, forms an agreea le conserve, tasting somewhat like cran-
berries. (Nattall Gen. ). In British gan-dens, two or three of the sorta occa-
sionally occur, but they are not common in collectione. The largest nyssa
that we know of in E land is at Richmond, where, in 1836, it was 46 st.
high. The trees whic h'ave flowered in England have, as far as we are
muare, onl produced male blossoms3 but, to compensate for the want of
fruit, the olrage of all the species of the genus dies off of an intensely
scarlet. The different sorts are almost always raised from seeds3 and
with the names of Ν. denticulata, N. mmentosa, N. aquatica (Ν. bifldra), N.
candicans, and N. sylvfifica, according to Charlwood s Calalogue for 1836,
are sold at le. a packet. Planta, in the London nurseries, are 2⁸. fid. each:
at Bollwyller 2 francs3 and at New York, from 25 cents to 1 dollar.
