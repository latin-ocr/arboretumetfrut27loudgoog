As Hie Ula-uatum οπ Hie Suqy'ect qulantmg and eheltering Oake, we give the
following abstract of the ,practice adopted '’{qthe verument officers in the
national foreste, and more especially in the ew orest, where, as we have
already observed, it was introduced by Mr. Turner. This abstract was pre-
pared by Alexander Milne, Esq„ in answer to a question by Lord Hatherton,
who intended to plant oaks extensively, as to the best mode of proceeding;
and a copy of it was kindly presented to us by Mt. Milne :—“ When the new

plantations in the royd foresta (now exceeding 40‚000 aeres) were first under· '

taken, the opinions of the most extensive owners and growers of oak timber,
and of the most ex ‘eneed n enin various parts of the kingdom, were
resorted to, as to e most advisab e methods ofplanting, and especially as to
the expediency of mixing Seotch pines in plantatione the ultimate object of
which was oak3 audit is rather extraordinary, that the majority of the opinions
received were against such mixture. Accordingly, in the most favoni-able
soils and situations, oalts only were planted at first: but in spots where it was
thought doubtful if oaks would grow, Scotch pines were planted with a small
proportion of oaks intermixed3 and it was soonjfound that in many of those
spots, even under the disadvantages of inferior soil and greater exposure, such
was the benefit derived from the warmth and shelter of the ' es, that the
oaks far ontgrew their neighbours planted in more favo le soils, but
without the same protection. Aster this, the use of Seotch pines became
more general: strong belts were planted on the most ex outsides of the
plantatione, and also across, at intel-vals, in lines, towar the most evailing

winds, and stom these great benefit was found; but in all cases w ere oaks ·

equal quanuty of oaks and pines, planting both at the same tune: the con-
sequence of which was, that the pines got on immediately, but the oaks
remained stationary for a few years, until the pines got sufficiently advanced
to afford them shelter3 and, m the intel-mediate time, aportion of the oaks
died, and some were choked by the high grass, briars, διο, with which they
might happen to be surrounded. For several years past, the plan pursued
lms been, to lant the enclosures with Seotch pines only, as soon as they are
fenced in autfdrained (if draining is required„ and when the pines have got
to the height of 5 ft. or 6 st„ wluch they will do m as many years, then to put
in good strong oak plants of about 4 or 5 years’ growth, among the pines, not
cutting away any pines at first, unless they happen to be so strong and thick
as to overshadow the σὼ. In about 2 years it becomes necessary to shred
the bra-ebes of the pines, to ’ve light and air to the oaks ς and, in about 2 or
3 more years to graduafl to remove the ines altogether, taking out a
certain number eac ear, so at, at the end o 20 or 25 years, not a single
Seotch pine shall be εἴη although, for the first 10 or 12 ears, the plantation
may. have appeared to contain nothing else but pines. 'fle advantage of this
mode of planting has been found to be, that the pines dry and ameliorate the
soil, destroying the coarse grass and brambles which frequentl choke and
injureoaks3 and that no mending over is necessary,as scarceyan oak so
planted is found to fail. It is not an expensive method of planting, especially

with a. Scotch plantin spade. [ege Part 1ῧῂ Α man and boy may plant 500
