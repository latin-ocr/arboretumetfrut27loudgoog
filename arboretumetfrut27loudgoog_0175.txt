Desa-iption, dv. This species, Michaux observes, ‘⁴ is similar in its fo-

form, and a dull red colour. When ripe, it becomes shriveled, and osa reddish
brown or black, like a very small wild cherry. It is rather fleshy, and very
sweet. Michaux says that he has never seen the wood employed in any part
of the United statem but, from the analogy between this species and the
European one, he has no doubt but that the wood ⁰ bt be applied to the
mne purpose:- The tree, iu Britain, is very hardy an ornamental3 and it
poeseeees the propa-ty of keeping on all its leaves very late, and then, like

the other memes, dropping them all at once, so that they ma be swept away
at one time for litter. &occidenthlin is reedily known rom C'. australis
