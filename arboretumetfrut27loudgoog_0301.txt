J,uly. Koch has stated its European places of growth to i
as follows :- Moist rocks, or other moist places, of th

l ⁴ highest mountains above the limit os perpetual snow, i

Piedmont, Savoy, Switzerland, the Pyrenees, Germang
Carpathia, Transylvania‚ Britain, and Lapland. Hooker ht
remarked (ΒΓ. FL, ed. 2.) that he ossesses S. reticulam ,
obtained from Arctic America, and avi long silky hairs 1323
on both surfaces of the leaf. Mackay as not inserted the species in
the Flora Hiberraea. Lightfoot, as quoted by Smith, has noted the kind
of soil in which it occurs on many of the Scottish highland mountains
to be micaoeous. ‘⁴ r than S. herbacea, with stout, woody, rocumbent

Smith has deemed it akin to S. h eea. Koch has associat the two in
the same group. , In its rounded wrinkled leaves, villous when young, in
its buds, and in its branches, it bears much similarit to S. caprea, though
it is widely different in its inflorescenee. There are nts in the arboretum
of Messrs. Loddiges, in the Fulharn Nursery, an in the Goldworth Ar-

boretum. .

shrubs‚ most of them u rig t; all, or most of thern, remarkable for their
foliage, which consiste o leaves that are oblong-lanceolate, sost, hairy, silky,
and, in most, white and cottony on the under surfiice. The kinds are very
closely akin, each amon the rest. (Hook. Br. FL, ed. 2., adapted.) Only
S. lafica L., S. arenaria Z, and S. Stuartidna Smith, are associated together
