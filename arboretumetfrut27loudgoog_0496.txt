ing which name Mr. Atkinson observes (Hm-t. Tmns„ ad s., vol. i. p. 3363,
that the woodmen in the New Forest eall all the oaks that have dar -
coloured acorns dunmast (of which word durmast is supposed to be a cor-
ruption); and that dun-coloured acorns are found both on Q. pedunculata
and Q. sessiliflora. A variety of Q. sessiliflora was found by ΜΓ. Borrer
in North Devon, with large leaves, oblique at

the apex,as shown in fig. 1574. These leaves

are not quite so long as those of one of Mr.

Bree’s varieties (fig. 1584), which differ from

Mr. Borrer's in being pointed at the apex.

The only account which we are aware of, that

has been given of other British varieties on.

sessiliflora, is that b the Rev. W. Τ. Bree,

in the Gardener’s agam, vol. xu .571.

The varieties there mentioned were al found

at Corley, in the parish of Allesley. ΜΓ.

Bree’s communication was accompanied by

15 dried specimens, 5 of which we have

figured, and the rest shortly described.

‘⁶ When you examine these specimens,” Mr. Bree observes, ‘⁸ 1 think
you will come to the conclusion that our two so-called species of oak are
mere varieties ς but, thou there are sessile oaks bearing fruit on pe-
duneles, and peduncula oaks bearing almost sessile fruit, there is yet
a certain undescribable something about the trees, by means of which 1 mn
always distinguish each, without minutely examining either the acorns or
the leaf-stalks. There is little difference m the general form and outline of
the two trees when full grown 3 but youn seedlings of Q. sessiliflora bear
their leaves close to the stem, and not on ootstalks; so that, in this stage
of their growth‚ it is diffieult to distinguish them from Q. pedunculata.
Q. sessiliflora generally bears small acomsg but it sometimes produces ve

line large ones. The acorns, when ripe, have very generally a red or ink’
tinge3 so that, in nine cases out of ten, they are distinguished by loo 'ng at
