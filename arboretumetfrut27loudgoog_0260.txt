it forms a shrub5 st. οι· 6 ft. high, with k violet-coloured shiniug brancha:
but, according to the experience of Mr. For-bes, in the Woburn salictum,
it is a haudsome u right-growing tree, attaining the height of l2st. or
14- st„ with the preceding year’s branches of a gre ⁹ brown colour, and
the young twigs dnrk brown above, paler benect ‚ poliched, and some-
what ungulas, οι· stt-iate& and v brittle. lutrodueed in 1818. The
male, as observed in the London orticultural Society's arbon-emm, in
1835, iz an elegant kind, noticeable early in spring for its plentiful bloe-
soms, and subsequently for its leaves, which are remarkabl nent in their
figure and serramre,and more οι· less uliar as com with those of
kmdred kinds. The dnrk colour of e shoooe of the preceding year οι·
vesu-s is also an ornamenta] feature. There are planta at Woburn Abbey,
Henfield, and Flitwiek Home.
