the bwks of the Mississippi and the
Misaouri. The wood, according
to Michaux, is inferior to that of the white oak, and is little esteemed in
the Unitetj Statesz bnt, a<³‹201'tling to Pursh, the wood is excellent. There
are trees m the Hortoeultural Society’s Garden, and at Messrs. Loddiges’s.
The pertrait in our last Volume is from the latter.

The height of this trec, 0000τάἰῖΙὲ to
micham, rarely exceeds dost„ with
a trunk not more than 15 imin dia-
meter, and a head disproportion-
ately large3 owing to the ‘⁶ early
division of the trunk into limbo,
with which the secondary branehes
form more acute angles than is ⁴
usual with other trees. The.
branches are, also, bent into elbows ἱ
at certain distaneea, which rendere
the tree easily distinguishable, even
when the branches have fallen?

The burk is thin, and os a ⁴gre-yish

white. The wood is yellowish, and

with no tinge of red. The leaves

are on short petioles, and sqdeeply lobedas to have almost a star-like sh
whence Wangenhenm called lt Q· stellata. The upper lobes are much bruge}
than the lower ouen and the leaf is attenuated at its base. The texture is
conaceouS, and the colour is a dusky green above, and eyish beneath.
