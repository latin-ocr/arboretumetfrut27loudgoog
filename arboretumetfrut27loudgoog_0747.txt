who wrote some years asterwards, says, “ In divers places of Kent, as in and
about Gravesend, in the countrey, and elsewhere, very man prime timbers of
their old barns and houses are of chestnut wood3 and yet there is now scarce
a chestnut tree within 20 miles of the place, and the people altogether ignorant
of such trees. This sheweth that in former times those places did abeund
with such timber.” (Leg ‚ δια, p. 18.) A proof how early the idea pre-
vailed os the wood of Qu rcus sessiliflora being that of the chestnut. In
the year 1676, an ancestor of the family of Wyndham of Felbrigg, in Nor-
folk, was said to be a great planter of chestnuts; and some account of his
trees will be found in a succeedin page. The tree, however, was compara·
tively neglected, till towards the atter end ‘of the last century ς when the
Society of Arts, reviving the idea (which, as we have seen above, was cur.
rent as lon ago as the time of Henry vl11.)‚ that the carpentry of many of
our old b dings consisted of chestnut wood, offered rewards for planting the
tree3 and these were given to a number os individuale who made plantations
of it. The tree is now chiefl planted as cop ice-wood and for its fruit in
En land, and as an ornamenta tree in Scotlamfand. Ireland. In England, it
is c iefly planted in hop countries, and on the marglns of orchards‚ as a fruit
tree. There are considerable plantatione of it in Devonshire, from which large
quantities of fruit are sent to the London market.

ln France, as in Britain, it was formerl believed that the timber in the
roofs of the oldest cathedrale, and in the ouvre and other buildings, was of
chestnut3 and it was thought, in consequence, that the tree had, m former
times, been much more abundant in France than it now is in that country.
Buffon, however, demonstrated that oak wood, after a great number of years,
puts on the appearance of that of the chestnut; and, asterwards, Daubenton,
as we have seen p. 1787.), set the question at rest, by showing that what had
been taken for c estnut was Q. sessiliflora. At the same time, it is observed
in the Dictionnaire des Eam· et For-ets, that chestnut trees must formerly have
been much more common in France than at present3 because orchards of
them are osten referred to under the name of chataigneraies in ancient writings ς
and Acosta reporta that the groves of chestnut trees in France were almost
totally destroyed in 1709, by a very severe frost, which followed suddenly after
heavy rains. In the Dictionnaire Univereel (published at Lyons in 1791, art.
Chataignier), it is stated, from the records o the city of Orleans‚ that ‘⁸ the
Forest of Orleans has been observed to change alternately the species of its
timber3 to have been for a space of time in oak, then in chestnut, and aster·
