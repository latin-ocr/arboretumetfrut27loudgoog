Ρνυραςαεὶοπ, dv. The trembling poplar ma be propagated b cuttings,
but not so readily as most other s ies. Vlyherever trees are ound, they
generally throw up suckers from whicliesslants may be selected; or cuttings of
the roots may be made-use of. In some situations, seedling trembling poplars
are abundant in the woods3 and these are sometimes collected hythe country

ffitle or no care is required, at least in Britain. On the Continent, and
particularly in Belgium, it is very subject to the attacks os insects, and espe-
cially to those of the larvae of different kinds of moths, butterflies, and Ten-
thredinidae. These are collected in the beginning of summer, by order of the
public authorities3 and payments are made to the collectors in proportion to
the quantit they bring in. The Upula juniperina L. la s its eggs in the
leaves and eas-stalks of this species3 in consequence of w ich circumstance,

also, from Hudson’s Bay to the northward of the Great Slave Lake, as far

Its usual period ofleafing, in E , is before that of P. tremula. T ere
