Osthis there are two principal kinds3 a smooth sort,¹ which sp likea
scurf over the herka and a rough sort, which hangs in little rich knots and
ffinges. 1 call it a brimstone hue, by way of general distinction3 but it some-
times inclines to an olive, and sometimes to a light grem. Intermixed with
these moeses ou osten find a species almost perfectly white. Before Ι was

there,.a tmch of it gives a lustre to the mmk, and has its effect: yet, on
the whole, it is a nuisanoe ς for, as it generally begins to thrive when the other
moeses begin to wither (as if the decaying bark were its proper nutriment), it

he refers to oak trees on the estaoes of Alloa, Airthrey,snd Alva, the two
