Rees's Cyclo.) A native of the mountains of L -
land. It is'said that Mesate. Lee and.Kenn y
first brought it into this country, in about 1780. It
rises to a small spreading tree, and flowers in April
or May. Brancboe blackish, hairy when very young

(For-bes.) Koch, viewing the species aa oom ‘sing
the varietiea indicated below and S. Wul enidna
Willd„ has given the geographical distribution of ‘
it as follows 3- Moist placen, and by rivers in the
alpine and subalpine regions of Savoy, Switzerland,
Germany, and Carpathia, Sweden‚ and Britain. Its
most certain British station seems that discovered
by Mr. F. Drummond‚ “by a small stream that asses through the sanda
of Bai-rie, near Dundee.” (Bor.) In the nont of Sweden, it inhabita
the boga of the lower regions and plain& S. malisolia Smitb, indicated
below as a variety os S. hastata, is the kind of the latter that is indi nous
to Britain. Koch, according to his view of the contents os S. tata
aa a species, has ascribed to it a variousness in the form os the leaf of from

lanceolate to ovate, with a beart-shaped base.
