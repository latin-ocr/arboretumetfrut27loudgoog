exceedingl difficult to propagate by any other method than from the acorn,

leaves have wi ered, and become οἴει russet colour, retaining them through-

the New Forent, neer Lyndhurst, mentioned by Parkinson‚ and by various
writers down to the time of Gilpin; and one, that we have heard os, in the
Vale of Gloucester. The forms of the trees also vary: some being much
