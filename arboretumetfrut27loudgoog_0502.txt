The growth of botii species, in about 10 years from the acorn, in good soil, in
the climate of London, may be stated as from 15 ft. to 18 st„ or even more, if
extra preparation were given to the soil. Both will attain the height of 50 st.
in 30 years, which may be considered the average height of the ’es in
ordinary soils in England; but, in deep loamy soils, both attain the eight os
looft. and upwards. The stem of the oak, Mai-shall observes, is naturally
short3 and, if left to itself, the tree, in an open situation, will enerally feather
