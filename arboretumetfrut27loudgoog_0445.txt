οι· low tree, eald to be a native of Hungary, Austrm, and Turkey. It was
introduced by Miller, in 1749, who is stud to have raised it from seed ς and,
if so, it must be a tolerably distinct kind3 which, indeed, it appears to
be, though we are doubtful aa to whether it iaentitled to rank an a species.
The largest plant of Α. oblongum that we have heard of is in the Glasneviu
Botanic Garden, where, in 1834, aster being 30 years planted, it is 30 st.
high 3 which confirma Willdenow’s conjecture, that, in a mild moist climate,
it may become a tree. There are planta in the Horticultural Society’s
Gan-dens, and at Mesate. Loddiges’s.
