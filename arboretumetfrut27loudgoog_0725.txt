.· On Gilpin’s observatione on the beeck), Sir T. D. Lauder justly observes,
that they efford “ oneos the instances in which the author's love for the art
of representing the objects of nature with the ⁸ cil, and his associations with
the pleesures of that art, have very much led ΕΞ estray. We are disposed to
go along with him in a great measure, so far as we, like him, draw our asso-
ciatione with this tree from the same source. But we conceive we have much
the advantage of him, in being able to ind e in the plessures arising from the
contem lstion of a noble beech ss one o the most magnificent objects of
God’s ⁶ crestion. Some of the very circumstances which render it un.
pietu e, or, in other words, which render it an unman ble subject of
art, hig ¹ eontribute to render it beautiful. The lezed su e of the leaf,
