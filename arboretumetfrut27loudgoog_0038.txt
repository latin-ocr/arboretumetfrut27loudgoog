weaker, and more dwarf, than the species.

The wild rosemary is a native of the south of France‚
Spain, Italy, the Levant, Barbary‚ δια, on rocks and rocky
hills; and, in some placen, it is so abundant, that in spring,
when it is in flower‚ the air is perfumed with its odour to
a considerable distance. On this account, and also from the

it is a native. In Narbonne -and Mahon, the rosemary is >210³ , l
so abundant, partly from being indigenous, but principally ‘⁴‘ ²
from its being frequently used there to form hedges to gar-

is considered the finest in France. The rosemary is men-
tioned, in many of the old Continental songs of the trouba·
dours, as emblematic of that constancy and devotion to the
fair sex, which was one of the characteristica of the days of
chivalry. Garlands and chaplets were formed of· myrtlc, ,μς-κζ, ·

and, on the latter account, is considered as the emblem of
fidelity in lovers. Formerly, it was worn at weddinge, and also at funerals;
and it is still grown for that purpose in many parts of the Continent. Many
allusione have been made to both customs by oete, and also to its being
the symbol of remembrance. Shakspeare m es Ophelia say, “ There’s
rosemary for γους that’s for remembrance;” and in the notes to Stevens’s
edition of Shakspeare arc many references to passages referrin to this

lant in the works of the old poeta. It is said to be found wild in e Great
heser& and Moore, in allusion to this, and its use for funeraIS, saw,—

“ 'nie humble rosetum,
whose evectu so thanklcssly are obed
To soent the desert and the desd.”

          

 

The points of the shoots area most powerful bitter, and they are aromatic;
they, also, when distilled with water, yield a thiu, light, pale, essentia} oil, at
the rate of 8 oz. of oil to 100 lb. of the herb in a een state. The oil of the
flowers (which ought always to be gathered with t eir calyxes) is somewhat
more volatile than that of the leaves, and is readily extracted with spirits os
wine. This oil contains a considerable quantit of camphor. The oil of
rosemary was in great use amongithe Greeks an Romans, and still forms an
article of the materia medica. ungary water (so called from bein first used

apothecaries and perfumers, a conserve, a honey‚ and a liqueur, are made from

of rance, it will scarcely live through the winter, in the o n air, in the
neighbourhood of Paris3 and the varieties, except the broad eaved one, are
kept there in the conservatory. In some parts of Germany, especially in the
catholic cpuntries (at Nuremburg, for example), rosemary is cultivated ‘in
