great importance to the painter. As well, it

has been observed by Gilpin (see p. 1790), might an artist attempt to deli·
neate the figure of a Hercules without expressing any of the muscles in his
body, as to give the drawing of an oak tree without a scientific regard to the
anatomy of its form, in a ‘ust display of the various angles and tortuous irregu-

larities of its branches.

tions which are brought 'nearer to the sight, the form o the individual leaves
(fig. 16420) may here and there be expressed, as shown in the sketch, which
also exhibita what is technically called the touch (b) necessary to express its
character as it recedes from the eye.

‘⁸ The colom-ing of the oak, and, indeed, of all natural objects connected with
landscape, admits of so great a variety, that it is impossible to give any precise
