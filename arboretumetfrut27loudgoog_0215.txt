peared beibre the author’s death. This volume is limited to figuring and deserb-
mg the willows of Austria, amounting to 60 sorts ς of which engravings are given
of both sexes. 011 extra-large folio plates = the specimens being of the natural

flower, when the leaves are sully expanded, and the female catkins matured.
This is indeed a splendid work, and only equallcd b the small portion which
appeared of the Historia &Ram of Hoffmann, δείξω mentioned. A great
drawback, however, to the utility of Host's work is, that the author has given
new names to most of his sorts, and has identified but a very few of them
with the kinds described b other botanists.

In 1829, His Grace the Duke of Bedford had printed, for private circulation,
the 3060111111 Weber-neme, in which 160 species are figured and described3 811
of which, with the exc tion of a very few, were at that time alive in the
salictum at Woburn‚ he engravings are small, but good ς the descriptions
are chiefly taken from Smith, but are partly original, by Mr. Forbes, the Duke
of Bedlbrd’s gar-dener. “ We have in the Salia-tum Wobarnense,” Sir W. J.
Hooker observes, ‘⁴ a standard set of figures of all the British, amongst many
exotic, specie-⁵3 which, together with those ol* theEnglieh Botan , do, it must be
confused, give to the British naturalist an advantage over all at Continental
authors have published on the subject3 and to them 1 refer in every instance,
and with grew satisfaction. The arrangement of the species in the 19αᾶ0111111
is due to the botanical skill and knowledge of ΜΓ. Forbes, head gardener at
Woburn‚ which His Gracc has fully acknowledged3 and that department does
him great credit.” §Bru FL, i. p. 416.)

In 1831,Sir W. . Hooker, m the second edition of his Bn'tisla Flora, had,
with the aid of Mr. Borrer, arranged the British species iu 18 groups, and
enumerated under these 68 species, considered by him and others aa indi-
genous3 which, in the third edition os the Britain Flora, published in 1835,
vereiucreased to 71. 111 the same ear (1835), Dr. Lindley adopted the
system of Koch in his S ’ qf e British Hom, 2d edit.. and reduced
the 71 species of Smith an om to 28 species. .

The willows of North America were, as far as they were known 111 1814,
described by Pursh, with the assistance of Mr. G. Anderson, who had in culti-
mion several rare species from th'at country3 and some species have subse·
quently been added by Nuttall. Since then, Dr. Barratt of Middletown, Con-
necticut, has under-taken to describe all the willows grown in America, whether
in ” ous or exotio, amounting to 100‚a conspectus of which he has sent to Sir
W. . Hooker, arranged in 9 groups, chiefly the sanie as those of Mr. Borrer.
(httings of most of these 100 soi-ts have been received by the Duke of Bed-
ford, and planted in his salictum at Woburn‚ where many of them are alive.
Some other particulare respecting them will be found in the Companion to the
Botanical Magnam, vol. i. p. 17. As Dr. Barratt's descriptions must neces-
sarily, in great part, be taken from dried specimens‚ it appears to us very
doubtful how far they will be of use to the European botanist3 but there can
be no doubt as to the benefit which will result from the introduction of all
these sorta into British gar-dens, because there they may be compared in a
living state with the kinds we already possess.

Lightfoot, in his Flora Sentice, paid considerable attention to willow33 but,
according to Sir J. E. Smith, ‘⁸ he laboured at the subject with hesitation and
misti-nst, from an opinion of the· species being confounded by crosa-impreg-
nation.” Lightfoot, and his contemporary Hudson‚ therefore, Sir James adds,
have hardly enumerated a fourth part of the native willows of our island.
The cultivation of willemi, with a view to the determination os their specific
chmcters, was, according to Sir J. E. Smith, first taken up with vigour and
effect by James Crowe, Esq„ F.L.S.‚ of Lakenham, near Norwich, ᾗ· a most
excellent British botanist,” about the end of the last century3 and Sir James
E. Smith, writing in 1828, says that he had laboured full 30 years in the
study of willows 111 Mr.Crowe’s garden, which contained all the sorts that
could then be procured in any part of Britain. (Rees's Cycl.) Mr- Georgo
