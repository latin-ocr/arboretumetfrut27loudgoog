Ver-Setia. In- consequence of U. glabra ripening seeds in different parts-of
England‚ many varieties have been raised from it, most of which are distin-
guished by great rapidity of growth. From the specimens that have been
sent to us from the Canterbury, Huntingdon‚ 8ηά other nurseries, and also
from the trees in the Horticultural Society’s Garden, it is difficult to de-
termine, in every case, whether the varieties of U. (m.) glabra are not near-er
to U. montana or U. americana, than to that sub-species3 and, in some m·
stances, they ap ear to partake of the character of U. campestris and U.
(c.) suberosa. . A. Knight‚ Esq„ informs us that from seeds of one variety
of U. ( m.) glabra, viz. the Downton elm, which were ripened in the cold
climate of that part of Shropshire, he ‘⁸ raised planta which are so perfectly
similar to the U. subal-om and which approximate so nearly to the character
of the U. glabra, that ’' he does ‘⁸ not doubt but that the U. campestris, U.
suberosa, U. glabra, and three or four other varieties which ’³ he has “ seen
in different parts of England, are all varieties only of the same species.”

Wood, nurseryman, near Huntingdon‚dated November, 1836. —“ The
Huntingdon elm,'' he says, “ was raised here about 80 or 90 years
ago, by 88 uncle of mine, from seed collected in this nei hbourhood.

American elm, which he considers as 8 s nonyme to the Hunting-

shoots of U. campestris alba Maste-rs, and of U. c. acutifdlia Mas-
ters, strongly resemble those os the Huntingdon elm. The tree
marked as the Huntin don elm in the Horticultural Society's Gar·
den was, in 1834, 35 high, after being 10 years planted.
