Description. In favourable situations, in the south of Preme, Spain. and
Italy, and also in the wan-mest parts of England and Ireland, the Q. Plex
forms a busby evei-green trae, exceed' the middle aize. The trunk is
generally furmshed with branchea from ground , ,

rowed, but never corky. The leaves vary exceedingly in sbape and aize,
from 5in. in length and nearly Sin. in breadth (as in Q. Ῑ. latifolia and Q.

 

I. ‘folia)‚ to lm. in length and in. in breadth (as in Q. I. crispa), or imin

are prickly, like those of the holly3 and, when this is the case, the most prickly
are nearest the ground; a circumstance beautifully exemplified in a fine trec at
Purser’s Crosa. The colour of the leaves is a dark green3 and, being conve:

above, and quite smooth, they have a fine shining appearance. Thfiffien
are either revolute and entire, ιη· y notched and serrated, ed

with mucros, or wavy and spiny-toot ed, like the holly. Beneath, they are
more or less hom-y or downy3 and in some varieties, such as Q. Ι. “ lia..
they are on the under side very distinctly seather-nerved. The ootstalks
are from ξ in. to ἦ in. in length, and generally downy. The male nowers are
disposed in catkins14 in. in length, which come out from the axils of the leaves
of the preceding year, and towards the extremities of the branches. The
calyx ia campanulate, and the stamens 6, with filaments twice the length of
the divisions of the calyx. The female flowers are from 4 to 8, sessile, and
soettered along a common peduncle, which is from l in. to 2 in. in length, and
is placed in the axils os the leaves of the current year. The are succeeded
by acorns, which are oval, smooth, and contained in a cup o from a third to

a half of their length, covered with very slender scales, very closely imbria-ted,
