was dry and dusty, while it was quite otherwise with the line of a few Lom-
,bardy poplars; for from them it rained so plentifully, and so fast, that any
one of them might have been· used as an admirable shower-bath, and the con-
stant stream of water supplied by the aggregate would (properly directed) have
sufficed to turn an ordinary mill.'' (Mag. Nat. Hist„ vol. iv. p. 34.)

In British nurseries‚ hedges sor shelter are frequently formed of the Lom-
bardy poplar3 in which case they are cut over at a certain height, and regularly
cut tn on each side, so as to form a verdant wall, Βῆ. οι· 10 st. h· h, 18 in.
wide at bottom, and 6 in. wide at top. It is an excellent tree for s eltering
or shading either fields or gardens in a flat country3 but care must be taken
to plant it at a sufficient distance3 and, where shelter is wanted without shade,
not to introduce it on the south side of any garden or orchard, unless at a
distance of at least twice its ordinary height.

the banks of the Po, has been much introduced in English lantations. It
secans to like a British soil, and its youth is promising3 but 1 ave never seen
it in full maturity. Its conic form, as a deciduous tree, is peculiar. Among
evergreens, we find the same character in the c press ς and both trees, in many
situations, have a good eli'ect. The c ress, ο ιι, among the ruins of ancient
Rome, breaks the regularity os a w or a pediment, by its conic form ι and
the plar on the banks of the Po, no doubt, has the same effect among its
deciffiousbrethren, by forming the apex of a clump3 though 1 have been
told that, m 1ts age, it loses its shape, and spreads more into a head. The
oldest poplars of this kind I have seen are at Blenheim. They are not old
trees, but are very tall, and, 1 believe, still preserve their spiry form. One
beauty the Italian plar ssesses, which is almost peculiar in itself; and
that is the waving ΕΖΒ it orma when agitated by the wind. Most trees, in
this· circumstance, are partially itated: one side is in rest, while the other is
in motion. But the Italian pop waves in one simple swee from the top
to the bottom, like an ostrich feather on a lady's head. Al the branches
coincide in the motion: but, in painting, I know not that 1 should represent
any kind of motion in a tree, except that of a violent storm. When the blast
continues for some time, when the black heavens are in unison with it, and
help to tell the story, an oak straining in the wind is an object of picture-«sque
beauty3 but when the gentle breeze, pressing upon the uivenng poplar,
bends it only in easy motion, while a serene sky indicates t e heavens to be
at peace, there is nothing to act in concert with the motion of the treet it
seems to have taken its form from the influence of a sea air, or some other
malign impression3 and, exhibiting an unnatural appearance, disgusts. One
thing more 1 should mention with regard to the Italian po lar3 which is, that,
although it sometimes has a good effect when standing singly, it generally has a
better when two or three are planted in a clump.” (For-eet Scenery, vohi. p. 58.)

satnguing to the eye when it lines the road for many miles, aa it does very
