Ρῑσπίιηππι of Linnaem, and the Species plantarum of Willdenow, have the
,Ὗζῗτωᾼὲἱοξίἓῗτωᾝὲοἵουῗέωῆαῳ ¹iiji‘llmlie found 'the characters os Koch’s
10 different groups; and under each the narnes and synonymes of the species
rinch he has assigned to thern. ·

From the perusa! os Koch's observations, two points, we think, will be ren-
dered clear to the botanical render 2—1. 'l'hat the mode of arran ‘ the
sections according ιο the character of the leaves, adopted by all the innaean
school previously to the time of Wahlenberg, is altogether defective3 and,
2. That the stem of thr-owing the species into natural groups, as a'dopted by
Wahlenberg, ries, Koch, and Borrer, is the true one. Being ourselves of
this opinion, the only question that remained for us to decide was, whether
ve should follow Koch or Borrer in the arran t of the species described
in this work aa in a living state in British ens.

'l'he excellence of Koch’s system was strongly impressed on our mind
stom the moment that we saw ιι developed ih Dr. Lindley’s δμῳαὶ c( the
Biih'sh Fibra ,- and, if we could have cla-sed all the numerous sorta of wi lows

on endeavouring to obtain e advice and andstance of the first authority in

st once,in the most kind and liberal manner, classed the sorts contained in the

sorta, they are thrown in the fo owing article. Mr. Borrer’s knowledge

Thepbotanigal details which we have given of each particular species, in-
dndingacomparison ofspecimens obtained in a li ‘ state fromthearbo-
retum at Flitwick, from that at Goldworth, and from t e salictum at Messrs.
Loddiges'a, were madeout for uss‘with great care and indum-y, by Mr. Denson.
Our were chiefl drawn sor us by Mr. Sowerby‚ from specimens received
from e salictum at &oburn Abbey; in the single instance of the S. caprea,
reduced stom Host’s work3 and nearly all the remainder, including all the 28

lates of leaves of the natural size, by the kind permission of the Dulie of

ord, have been copied from the Salio-tam Wobumeme.

It vill thus ap that our article, lengthy and elaborate as it is, is, in a
botanical point view, chiefly to be considered as matter for a history of
willon, rather than as a complete history in itself. Such a history, indeed,
ean onl be prepared by a botanist who has haid all the ccies in a living state
under ' eye for several years; and who has appli to them one general
