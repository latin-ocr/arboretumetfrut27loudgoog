branc which surrounds it is narrower. The wood of the tree is hard,
and yellower than that of the common birch. Pallas says that it differs
from B. nigra L. (the red birch of Amen-ica), in having smaller stipules, and
in the leaves being less frequently, and never doubly, serrated3 but, ashe
had only an opportunity of comparing it with a small dried specimen of
the American species, of which he has ' given us a figure, we cannot place
much confidence in his opinion. The youn planta bearing this name at
Messrs. Loddiges’s have every appearance ο bein nothing more than a
stunted variety of the common birch 3 but these p ts are too small and
unhealthy to enable us to determine, with certainty, whether the are
really of the kind described by Pallas, or not. This species was intr uced
in 17963 but it is not common in collectione. There is a tree at Croome
bearing this name, which, ,aster being 30 years planted, is 40 st. high. One
in the Glasnevin Botanic Garden, 35 years planted, is 30st. high3 and
one in the Botanic Gai-den at Munich, 25 years planted, is 20 st. high.

The whole plant has a stunted appearance.

The buds are numerous, and come out soon

aster those of B. alba. The leaves are small,

and generally two from the same bud. They

are lengthened out, and entire towards the

petiole; and towards· the end, which is very

sharp, they are un ually serrated. The

male catkins are sessi e at the ends. of the

their form is cylindric, and they are lo er than those of B. nana5 the
scales are narrow at the base, three-fork at the end; and there are three
seeds to each scale, of the same size and form as in B. nana. Pallas found
this species in marshes, and on rocky mountains in the cold subalpine re-
gions of 'Eastern Siberia. According to Willdenow, it is also found in
Canada, and in Germany, in Bavaria, and Mecklenburg. About Berlin, it
grows to the height of 4ft. or 5 ft. It was introduced in 18183 and there
are plants at Messrs. Loddiges’s, and in some other collectione.
