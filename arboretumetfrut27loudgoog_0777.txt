Geograplay.nghe hazel 18 8 native of all the temperate climatea of Europe

in the north of England, it attains to the elevation of 1600 st. (Winch); 8ηά
it 18 found at about the 881118 1181 ton the 111118 of Forfarshire and Aberdeen-
abire. ( Watson’e Outlineae, διε.) 11 Lochiel, Argyllshire, between 700 st. 8ηά
800 st. above the 888, there was, in 1832, 8 8111811 wood of nut 11888, producing
abundance of fluit, and 801118 of them with trunks of above lft. in circumfe-
rence. (Ibid.) The line of nuta on the Alpa, between 45⁰ and 46⁰, ia stated by
H. C. Wateon to riseto 3798 ft., the anow line being 908011. 111 Sweden,
according to Professor Schouw, the hazel 18 found on the west side of He-
ligoland, in lat. 6003 while on the eastern aide of the great mountain range
it reaches to lat. 60—6103 and, though met with more to the northward,
in the Gulf of Bothnia, yet it does not there go beyond 630. In short, it 18
considered 88 not extending beyond the region of the beech. (See Gar-d. Mag„
