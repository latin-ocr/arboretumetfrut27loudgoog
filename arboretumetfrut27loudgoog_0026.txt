the height of 10 ft„ against a wall, in 3 .

γεω-ες and its stem is between 3 in. and

4in. in diameter: one in the Olapton

Nurscry is still larger. As this species

will grow in any soss, and is readily pro-

pagzited by cuttings, it promises to be

of great valuc as an ornamental climber, for rapidly covering nakcd
wallS. Dr. Lindley observes that, “if tied to a stake, and thus forced
to grow creet, it will throw out agreat number of laterai branchletS, at the
end of every one os which is a bunch of flowers. lt this state it was ex-
hibited by Mr. Lowe of Clapton, at a meeting of the Horticultural Society,
in April, 1832, and was greatly admired.” (Boi. Reg„ t. 1516.) Itis readily
propagated by cuttingS, and promises to be a most valuable shrub for
covering naked walle, or varying ruins or rockwork. The smooth shining
green of its leaveS, which are seldom caten by insect8‚ and the profusiori os
its flowch, which are bluish, render it highly ornamental.
