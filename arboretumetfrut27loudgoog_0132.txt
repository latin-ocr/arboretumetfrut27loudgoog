The clm has been a well known tree since the time of the Romanu aud,
of all the European trees, it is thet which is the most generally cultivated.
and most commonly a plied to agricultural purposes. The reasons for
this reference, no dou t, are, thet its culture is extremely easy3 its growth

The elm is remarkable for the aptitude of the different species to vary from
seed; so much so thet it is extremely difficult to say in this genus which are
s ecies and which are varieties3 or even to what species the varieties belong.
