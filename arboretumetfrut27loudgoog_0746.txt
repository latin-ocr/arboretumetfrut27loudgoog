however, that the Spanis ueen's visit is somewfl t apocryphal. The tree
itself, when visited by M. ouel, was in a state of deeay: it had lost the

which, according to th’e custom of the guent} they ried c'hestnuts, filhein,
and other fruita, which they wished to preserve for winter use; using as fuel,
when they could find no other, pieces cut with a hatchet from the interior of
the tree. In Brydone’s time, in 1770, this tree mensured 204 st. in circum·
ference. He says that it had the appearance of five distinct trees; but that he
*was assured that the space was once filled with solid timber, and that there
was no bark in the inside. This circumstance os an old trunk‚ hollow in the
interior, becoming separated, so as to have the pearance of being the
remains of several distinct trees, is frequently met wit in the case of very old
mulberry trees in Britain, and olive trees in Italy. Kircher, about a century
before Brydone, affirms that an entire flock of sheep might be enclosed within
the Etna chestnut as in a sold. The sweet chestnut was, in all probability,
introduced into Britain in the time of the Romans, for the sake of its fruit;
and, being a tree of great duration, and ripeni its fruit, it could hardl
fail to become a permanent inhabitant. The old c estnut tree at Tortwo

(fig. 1924„ to a scale of lin. to 12 ft. may, indeed, possibly have been one
of those planted by the Romans. Τ e oldest chestnut tree in the neigh-

bourhood of London is that at Cobham, in Kent, of which fig. 1925. is a
pertrait, to a scale of lin. to 12 st. cambden mentions that Cowdray Park,

ln Sussex, was famous in his time forits chestnut trees3 and the town of
Cheshunt, in Hertfordshire, is supposed to have derived its name from the
number of chestnut trees that formerly grew there. Old Tusser, in 1562,
enumerata chestnuts, in his list of fruit trees which may be transplanted in
Januar53 and Lord Bacon mentions the chestnut in his Escay on Plantafions.
The tree, however, if once plentiful‚ appears soon to have become compara-
tive scarcely3 for the author of a tract entitled An old Thr-eft netoly revined,
published in 1612, recommends planting the chestnut as a ‘⁶ kind of timber
tree of which few grow in England;’' and which, he adds, will not only pro-
duce “lar and excellent good timber,” but “ good fruit, that poore people,
in time of earth, may, with a small quantitie of oats or barley, make breed of?
He also says that a chestnut tree, “ when you begin first to plant it, will grow
priore in one years, than an oalte will doe in two.” (p. 7.) Mr. Samuel nantis,
