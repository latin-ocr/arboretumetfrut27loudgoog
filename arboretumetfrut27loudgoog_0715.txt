times, consecrated to Diana, by the common consent of all the inhabitants of
Latium, who paid their devotions to that goddess there. One of these trees
was of such surpassi beauty, that Passienus Crispus, a celebrated orator, who
was twice consul, who asterwards married the Empress Agrip ina, was so
fond os it, that he not only delighted to re ose beneath its sh e, hut fre·
quently poured wine on the roots, and used ol to embrace it.'' Beechen cups
were used by the Latin sh herds3 and this custom is frequently alluded to
by the poeta. The oldest itish writers on rural affairs mention the beech
as one of the four indigenous timber trees of England. Its timber, however,
was considered inferior to that of the three other timber trees, viz. the oak,
the ash, and the elm. The mast of the beech has been, from the earliest times,
valued as food for swine3 aud, in some parts of Buckinghamshire, where the
tree abounds, swine are still driven into the beech woods in autumn. About
1721, Aaron Hill, the poet, proposed a scheme for paying off the national
debt with the profits of the οἱ] to be made from⁴ beech nuts ς but his
scheme fell to the ground. Other plans for making beech οἱ] have been sug·

ness of the beech, at the time when foresta were chiefly valued for the number
of swine that they could sup together with the facility with which the
tree is raised from seed, must ave rendered it one of the first trees propagated
and planted by art. Accordingly, Gerard, in 1597, speaks of the excellent
effect which the nuts had in lattening swine, deer, and pigeons; and Par-
kinson‚ writing in 1640, says that the beech is planted in parke, foresta, and
chases, to seed deer ς but, in other places, to fatten swine, ‘⁴ whose fat,’' he adds,

tree, the density of its shade, and the classical associatione connected with it,
independently altogether of the uses of its fruit, occasioned it to be earl

planted as an ornamental tree, both in Britain and on the Continent. e
find both Evelyn and Cook recommending it for shady walks, avenues, and
hedges3 for which latter purpose, where it is desired to enclose and warm
gardens, Boutcher observes, this tree has hardly an equal. Between 1790 and
and 1800, some trunks of beech trees were found at a considerable depth
below the surface, in St. Leonard's Forest, Hampshire. The had evidently

much ted in Scotland till between 1540 and 1560; and many of the trees
then p anted at Hopetoun House, Arniston, Inverary, and Newhsttle, still
exist, and are the oldest in the country. The beech was probably planted in
Ireland about the same time that it was introduced into Scotland3 and it
attains an enormous size on the calcareous loams and the sloping sides of hills
of that country. The first planted beeches in Ireland are believed to be those
st Sheltou Park; but the largest is in Charleville Forest. The most
extensive nter of the beech tree in Scotland has been the Earl of Fife,
who, in t e latter half of the last century, planted many thousand beech
trees in the county of Moray, for which he received the gold medal of
the Societ of Arts. In Enffind, aster the Revolution of 1688, when
william 1 1. introduced the tch style of gardening, the beech was much
planted for hedges, both for shelter in gardens and nurseries, and for form-
mg the clipped sides of alleys in women-ical plantations. Extensive plant-
atione of beech for timber were made, between 1784 and 1788, at Belmom in
Staffordshire, and by the Bishop of Llandaff near Ambleside. The tree still
continues to be planted3 but, now, more for ornamental purposes than for the
value of either its timber or its fruit. Between 1680 and 1690, Lord Scar-
borough, according to Mitchell‚ had an avenne cut through Stanstead Forest,
in Susse13 and within the Park, on each side of the entrance of the avenne,
there were about 10 acres planted with beech, which, in 1827, were from
