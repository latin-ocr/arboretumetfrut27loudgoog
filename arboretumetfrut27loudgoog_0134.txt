The timber is excellent3 and the tree forms poles of equal diameter
throughout. There are fine specimens of this tree in Minster,
Thanet, and at Ickham, near Canterbury. In Mr. May's ark, at
Herae, where there are several kinds of elms, all of whic thrive
remarkably well, one recently cut down shewed this day (Nov.
14. 1836) indicatione of upwards of 100 years' growth. A portion
of the trunk girts 15 st. for 16 ft. in length. The remaining part of
the tree has been appropriated. There is a tree 111 1118 Horticultural
Society’s Gai-den, marked U. c. rubra, which, judging from the spe-
cimens sent to us by Mr. Masters, appears to be identical with this
variety. [t is a splendid tree, and, in 1834, had attained the height
of 32 st„ with 8 trunk 7 in. in diameter, aster being 10 years planted.

1 U c. 6 virens Hort. Dur„ or Kidbrook Elm, is almost ever n in a
mild winter3 and, as such, is the most ornamental tree of e genus.
It must not, however, be depended upon as a timber tree, because,
in some autumus, the frost kills the 8110018. The bark is red, and the
tree of spreadin habit. This, like the last-mentioned kind, grows
well upon ch . Notwithstanding its name of Kidbrook elm, a

lace 111 Sussex, it is a Cornish variety. There is a fine tree in the
orticultural Society's Garden, named there U. montana nodosa,
which sully answers to the above description of Mr. Masta-s.

o London, is 8 week or ortnight later in coming into leaf than the
common elm. It attains a very great height, and hasa.somewhat
narrower head than the species. There are very large specimens
of it at Bagshot Park,7o years lanted, which are 70 ft. high3 the

Horticultural Society's Garden, one of which, in 1834, aster being
10 years lanted, was 15 ft. high3 and several at Messrs. Loddiges’s.
