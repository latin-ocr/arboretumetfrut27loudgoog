Geograpley, Hister-y, (9-0. The zelkoua is a native of the country lying
between the Black and the Caspian Seas, between lat. 35⁰ and 47 ‚ par·
ticularly of Imiretta and Mingrelia3 of the north of Persia, and of Georgia.
It was first described by Pallas, in his Flora Βοιαὶ-α (publiahed in 1784), under
the name of Rhamuus carpinifolius. In 1782, the elder Michaux under-
took “a 'ourney into Peraia, under the auspices of Monsieur (afterwards
Lonie X 111.)‚ in order to make botanieal reaearchea. Having left Is an,
in order to explore the province of Ghilan‚ he found thia tree in the oreste
which he traversed before arriving at Recht, a town aituated on the Caspiana
Sea. In thia town he had o ortuniuea of remarking the uae made of the
wood, and of ‘udging how hi) ly it was appreciated by the inhabitants-⁶
(Miohs. mle lleoua, p. ᾗ) he first tree introduced into Europe pear-
to have been lanted by . Lemonnier, professor of botany in the ardnn
des Plantes, c., (see p. 140.) in hia garden at Montreuil, near Veraaillea.
This garden was destroyed in 182ος and the dimensione of the tree, when it
waa cut down, will be found in p. 1410. The oldest tree now exieting in
France is in the Jardin dea plantes, where, in 1831, it was about 60 st. high.
It was planted in 1786 (when a aucker of four years old ‚ about the same
time aa the lime trees which form the grand avenue called e Allee de Bnffm.
There ia‚however, a much larger zelkoua on an estate of M. le Comte de Dijon,
an enthusiaatic plantet of exotic trees, at Podenas, near Νέης, in the depart-
ment of the Lot et Garonne. Thia fine tree was planted in 1789; and, on the
20th of January, 1831, it measured neeri eost. high, and the trunk was nearly
3 ft. in d'umeter at 3 st. from the und).⁷ A drawing of this tree, made by the
count in the autumn of that year, aa been kindly lent to us by M. Michaux 3
from which fig. lamis an engi-aving, to a scale of l in. to 12 ft. There are
several other trees of the zelkoua, at Podenaa, nearly aa lar 3 and some elma
planted thirty years before the zelkouaa, and measured at αξξ same time, were
only a few inchee more in aize. In England‚ the zelkoua appears to have been
planted at Kew‚ and at Syon, probably about the ear 1760, when it was first
introduced. A tree in the former garden ia u s of 50 st. high3 and, in the
latter, the tree of thia species figured in our last Volume was, in 1835, when
the drawing was made, upwarda of 54st. high.

Proper-fiee and Uses. Both the sap-wood and the beart-wood of the zel-
koua are need aa timber. The sap-wood ia white, and very elaeae, resembling,
in many ree cta, the wood of the aab. The beart-wood, which compriaea at
leuat two t irda of the whole, ia reddiah, and sometimes of a rusoet brown.
Thia wood, when cut obliquely, resemblee that of the robinia, and presente,
like it, numerous interlacementz of fibi-ea. It is very heavy, and, when dry,
becomes so extremely hard, that it ia difficult to drive naila into it with a
hammer. In the countries where it in abundant, it is employed sor the same

and ita grain ao fine, aa to render it mceptible of the highest poliah. It has,
also, the great advantage of never becoming wormeaten, however old it may
be. It ia remarkably durable aa pocta, to atand either in water or in‘ the
earth. (Mu-lae. Mem. surle Zelkona, . 9. 17.)

Propagation and Uulture, ‹5-c· Τ e zelkoua ia generally pr ted by
grafting on the common elm3 but we are told by M. Michaux t at M. le
OEevalier Gauba, the French consul at Tenis, who ia the proprietor of large
foresta in lmioetta, has had a great quantity of needs collected, and sent to
Plance, from which young planta have been raised. When grafted, M. Michaux
observes that the operation should be performed aa near the collar of the atock
