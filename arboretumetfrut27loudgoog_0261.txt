dne fagr-auce, which ia similar to t of the sweet ιινπ
buy (Lafirua nobilia), but less powerful‚ ia exuded 12990
from the resinous notches os the leaves, and from the barren cathina. It is one
of the most duait-able species of the genua sor planti in plausum-grounds on
account os the fine display made by the blossomffiffieir abundant fmgrar'xce,
the smooda, nhining, rich deep green of the leaves, and the com tively
alow owth and compact haba of the trae. Mt. Forbea states at, when
