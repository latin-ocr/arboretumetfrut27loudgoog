Cryptorhynchus pathi is exceedingly abundant in the osier beds near

Barnea and Mortlake. In the perfect state, it is very sluffigiicsh, remaining

nearly stationary upon the leaves and slender twigs, to w h it attaches

itself very firmly‚ by means of its broad cushioned tarsi, and probably, also, by
the bent hook at the extremity of the tibiae. Several interesting particulare
'are recorded relative to this species in Howitt’s Book qs the Scatone. In
the late ΜΓ. Haworth's Review ο Entomology, published in the first part
of the old Entomokgical Society’s aneae-tiens, is given an extract from the
Ashmolean Appendtr to Ray’s Historia Imectorum, relative to the “ Curculio
lapathi of Linnaeus, the ancient spelling of which appears to bave been

a we l·lmown insect; and the other, because, according to this ingenious author,
