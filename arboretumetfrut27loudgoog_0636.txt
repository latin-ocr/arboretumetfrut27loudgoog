The leaves of Q. rubra die off of a more purplish red than those of most of
the other kinds in this section ς but they often become yellow before they fall.
The vary much in shape, from the age of the plant, or the soil and situation
in w ich it has grown. Εἰς, 1740., copied from the elder Michsux’s Histoire
des Che'nes, shows the leaves of a seedling a year old3 fig. 1741„ froin the

same work, those of a tree beat-in acorns; fig. 1742. shows several leaves
guthered from trees in En land four or fiye ἕρκε’ growth3 fig. 17213. is
drawn from a specimen en from a tree ιιι t e Homcultural Society s

Garden3 and fig 1744. is a leaf from phe splendid fun-grown tree in the Fulham
Nursery, of which there is a posu-alt ιιι

our last Volume. By comparing the
plates of the trees of this species in

our last volume, it will be seen how

exceedingly the leaves vary. The

scorns are sessile, or on ver short

peduncles3 they are large, an are produced in great abundance3 they are
rounded at the summit, and compressed st the base ς and they are contained in
flat very⁴ shallow cups, covered with nan-ow compact scales. The red osk is
one of the most common species in caneda, and the whole of the north of the
United States. ln the states of New York, New Jersey, part of Philadelphin,
and along the whole range of the Alleghanies, it is nearly ss abundant as Q.
coccinea and Q. tinctoris ς but it is much less common in the more southern

states, its perfect developement tela-iniring a cool climate and a fertile soil.
