aud Royle mentions several species as indigcnous both to the lowlands and
mountainous regions of Northern India. S. pedicellata Degf. and S. baby-
‚16nica are found wild in the north of Africa3 and S. Humboldtidna and
S. Bonplanda'a'na on the mountains of Peru and Columbia. The species
indipnous to North America are not very numerous; but Pursh has de-
scribed 37 sorte, as either wild or in a state of cultivation there. The
number of species in different countries, however, cannot at present be deter-
mined with anything like accuracy‚ since what are considered as species by
some botanists are looked upon as only varieties by others, Thus, Schleicher
finds 119 species within the narrow limits of Switzerland3 Host, 60 species
natives of Austria3 and Smith, and other British botanists, 71 species in-
digenous to Britain. Koch, however, the latest, and, as it a pears to us, the
most judicious, writer on the genus Salix, considers that al the alleged spe-
cies, natives of Euro e, may be reduced to 48. PerhapS, in addition to
these, there ma be a ozen natives of North Amen-ica, which are not natives
of Europe; an half that number natives of Asia. Of 182 species described
by botanists, Koch observes, 17 only are extra-European.

Hastam. Theophrastus and Pliny speak of different sorts of willows; the
latter describing 8 specics, as among the most usefiil of aquatic trees, not even
excepting the poplar and the alder. The willow, Pliny says, furnishes long

descriptions, to have been the S. alba, S. Vitellius, S. vnmmhhs, and the S. ame·
rina of Pliny and Dalechamp, which was probably, as Dr. Walker thinks, the
white willow of Theophrastus, and is certainly the S. decipiens L. These
kinds formed the osier holts of the Romans, and are still those principally

· cultivated for basket-making‚ throughout Europe and North Aruernos, in the
present day. Among modern botanists‚ the BauhinS, in 1650, first began to
distinguish willows by their magnitude, the shape of their leaves, and by the
nature of their flowers and fruit: and these authors were also the first to
recognise in each species a fertile and an unsertile individua13 and, with
Tragus‚ to assert that willows could be propagated from seed, like other plants 3
a fact that had been denied since the days os Aristotle. Scopoli, in his
Flora Camiolica, published in 1760, relates that he had often observed female
willows fecundated by males which are accounted of a different species; and,
if this observation is correct, it will help to account for the great number of
kinds which compose this genus. The scientific botanical history of the wil-
low may be considered as commencing with Ray's Synopu's, in 1660, in which
he describes 10 species as growing in the neighbourhood of Cambrid . Lin-
naeus, in 1737, described, in the Flora Lapponica, 19 specics, chieff} alpine
kinds; and in the second edition of his Species Plantarmn, published in 1753, 31
s ies. Haller, in 1758, described 21 s ecies as natives of Switzerland3 and
Weiiclars, in 1789, 30 species as nativos of anphine. Willdenow‚ in his edition
of Linnoeus’s δρα-ἕω Planum-um, published in 1797, describes 116 species.
Smith, in Rees's C elqoaedia, published in 1819, describes 141 s ecies; to which
Willdenow and ot er botanists have since added, according to och, 41 species
more, making in all 1823 adding to these Schleicher’s 119 new species, the
total number is 254! In 1785, Hoffinann published the first fasciculus of his
elaborate History of Willowe, the last fasciculus of which came out in 1791 ;
but the work was never completed. In so far as it goes, it is a splendid work;
and one which ean scarcely be surpassed either for accuracy or beauty. ln
1828, Professor Koch, director of the botanic garden at Erlangen, published
his De Saticibm Eur-cyma} Commutatio, an admirable work, of which a more

‘cular account will be given here aster3 in which he has reduced all the
fflopean sorts, amounting‚ as we have just seen, to 237 (17 of the 254 being
extra-European ,το 48 species, belonging to 10 groupS. Subsequentl to the
