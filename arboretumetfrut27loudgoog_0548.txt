stoutness of its limbs. We know trec, except, haps, the cedar of Leba-
non, so remarkable in this respect. The limbs o most trees ring from the
trunk: in the oak they may be rather said to divide from it; or they gene-
rally carry with them a great share of the substance of the stem. You osten
scarcely know which is stem and which is branch; and, towards the top, the
stem is entirely lost in the branchos. This, 'ves articulat propriety to the
epithet ‘ fortes: ln characterising the branc es o the oak ; and hence its
smewy elbows are of such peculial· use in ship-building. Whoever, therefore,
- does not mark the ⁸ fortes ramos' os the oak, mi ht as well, in painting a Her-

In the effeminate nurslings of the ve we have not ‘s appearance. There
the trec is all stem drawn up into eight. When we characterise a tree, we
consider it in its natural state, insulated‚ and without any laterai pressure. In
a forest, trees naturally grew in that manner. The seniors depress all the
juniors that attempt to nse near them3 but in a planted 131?oe all grew up

in long reaches, and sometimes in shorter elbows. There is not a characteristic
more peculiar to the oak than this.

‘⁶ Another peculiarii: of the oak is its expansive spread. This, indeed, is a
just characteristic of e οὺς for its boughs, however twisted, continuall

beyond an other tree; and, like a monach, takes possession of the soil.
The last characteristic of the oak is its lon vity, which extends beyond that
of any other trec: perhaps the yew may an exception. 1 mention the
circumstance of its lopghcvity, as it is that which renders it so singular-ly pic-

Some valuable remarks on the pict , e beaut of the oak, and on its deli-
neation,will be found in the Magasineof atur-al gustovfficommunicated by Mr.
Strutt, unquestionably the best delineatur of trees ιιι this or any other country.
‘⁴ European trees,” he observes, “ may by the painter be divided into four
classes3 the round ped, as the oak, chestnut, elm, willow‚ ash, beech, διας .
the spiry0to ped‚as t e different species of thefirtribeg the sh -topped,
comprehending those of the pine; and the alenda-formed, as thfflmmrdy
