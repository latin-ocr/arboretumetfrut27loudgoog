hitherto seen formed by any cynipideous insect, is irregulari oblong, and nearly
5 in. in length: it ιε 11 m. m diameter nn the thickest art, the general thickness
being about 1 in. ε its appearance is that of a piece o very fine-grained spon .
On maki a section lssin. long by lin. broad, between 60 and ‘70 ls,
closely pffied together, and of an oval form, were discovered, each containing
a single cynips. Taking the size of the entire gall into consideration, it
must contain, at thelowest calculation, upwards of a thousand individuals, the
roduce, probably, of a single female cynips. The perfect insect is of a pale
rownish colour, with a shining red abdomen, having two small dorsal black spots
at the base. This gall was unknown to Reaumur, having been first described and
figured by Bosc. (Journ. de Physiquffi 1794.) A figure, apparently of the same
gall, is ven in the Imect Architect„ p. 385.; but it is there erroneously
stated at the inhabitant is identical with the cynips of the oak apple (C.
quercus terminalis) 3 and this is supposed to be accounted for by the observa-
tion, that the root galls are· “ probably formed at a season when the fly
perceivea, instinctively, that the buds of the young branches are unfit for the

buds or branches of the oak in their embryo o'r infant state, of which the
coadunate stems and witch knots are among the most remarkable3 but it is
‹tilpubtful whether many of these monstrosines are not idiopathic diseases of
e tree.
The oak leaves, also, are occasionally observed covered with numerous
ls of small size, and evidentl belonging to different species, being of dif-
erent forms, of some of which e insect has not
et been discovered. Several of them are figured
y Reaumur. (Menoires, tom. iii. pl. 35. fig. 3,
4. and 6. pl. 40. f. 13-15.) Some of these
are of a iai-ger size (fig. 1651.); not more than
three or four being found upon a single leaf
(Roeel Ins. Belaci. Suppl„ tab. 69.) ς whilst
others, which are as large as a boy s marble,
and perfectly globular, are often found singly

It ns a curious circumstance connected with
these large globular galls (and which is also
observed m t e gall nut), that, notwithstanding
the large size of the galla, only a single insect is
enclosed therein; so that a very small portion
only of the centro qf the ll is consumed, the

its way through a greaffortion of the solid sub-
stance of the gall. e surface of the majority of these galla is smooth3
some, however, are imbricated, and others are clothed with a woolly kind of
down, similar in its nature to the outside of the bedeguar of the rose. A gall
of this kind is figured in the Insect Architecture, p. 388„ found upon the twig of
an oak3 and in Dr. Nees von Esenbeck’s collection of minute Hymen6 tera,
at present in Mr. Westwood’s possession, there is a similar gall, of smal siae,
