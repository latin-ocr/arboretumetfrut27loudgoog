Poetical, mythological, and legendary Allusioni. According to the ancient
mythology, the white poplar was consecrated to Hercules, because he destroyed
wi a eon eenear 1m‚asaoeno isvico.
Whenlliepdescended inntg) the infgrnal regions, he also returned with a wreartyh
of white poplar round his head. (Stackb. Comm. de Th brasc„ p. 217.) It was
this, says the fable, that made the abele leaves of the efflat they are now. The
pers iration from the hero’s brow made the inner part of the leaf, which
touc ed his forehead, white3 while the thick smoke ansing from some parts of
the infernal regions turned the u per surface of the leaves almost black.
Persons offer-ing sacrifices to Herc es were always crowned with branches of
this tree3 and all who had gloriously conquered their enemies in battle wore
gai-land! of it, in imitation of Hercules. The poets frequently mention the
white poplar. Homer, when describin the shield of Ajax, son of Telamon,
states that it was made by Tychius, a s 'lful currier of Hyle; and it is said
that the Tychius thus immortalised was a real person, beneath the poplar tree
at whose door Homer had often sat, reciting his poems, while the kind-
hearted currier gave him food, and relieved his necessities. In another part
of the Iliad, Homer compares the fall of Simoisius, when killed by Ajax, to

that ofa poples: —

‘⁸ So falls a poplar that ln watery und

Ovid mentions that Paris had carved the name of OEnone on a oplar. Virgil,
in his Georgics, gives directions for the culture of this tree, an mentions itin
his Eclogues ,· and Horace, in his Ode to Dellius (lib. ii.)‚ s eaks of the white
poplar as a tree which delights to grow on the banks·o rivers. Modern
poets have also noticed this tree- Cowper sings of --

“ The poplar, that with silvei· lines his leaf 3⁹⁹

and Bal-ry Cornwall says,—

“ The green wood· moved, and the light popm· shook

Sterne, in his sentimenta! Journey, represents Maria as sitting under a poplar.
In the Sentiment ο Flowers, it is said that the ancients consecrated this tree
to time, because t e leaves are in continual agitation3 and, being of a blackish
green on one side, with a thick white cotton on the other, they were supposed
to indicate the alternation of day and night.
. Soil, Situation, P agation, and Uulture. For the abele to attain a large
size, the soil in whirgff it is planted should be loamy, and near water 3 though
on a dry soil, where the tree will grow slower, the timber w111 be finer-grained,
and more durable. In France, it is found to groW, not only in marshy‘places,
but in dry sands ς and it is a mistake to suppose that it will thrive in stagnant
marshes in any climate. The French writers recommend it strongly for
