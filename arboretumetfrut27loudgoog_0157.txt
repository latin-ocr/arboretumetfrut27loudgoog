“ at the seme time as U. montena, eud, hke tt, npeumg abundauce
gigseeda, which no American clm whatever does in Europe, we have ⁹
uot a doubt that it is a variety of U. montana. For paticular
eiumtioue iu artificiel scenery it is admirably adapted: for example,
sor atu-acting the eye,aud fixing it, in order to draw it away from
some object which cannot be couceeled, but which it is not de-
sit-able should attract notice. There is a beudsome tree os thiu
variety in the Hammuunith Nu ‚ where, efter being 12 years
planted, it is 30st. high. One in the orticultural Society ε Garden
was, iu 1834, after being 10 years lanted, 26 st. high.
