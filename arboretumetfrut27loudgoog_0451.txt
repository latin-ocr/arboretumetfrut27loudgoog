Description. The 1550
common birch, when
of 8 trec-like size, is
known, at first sight,
by the silvei-y white-
ness of its outer barli,
the smallness of its
leaves in com arison

When drawn up in
woods, however, in
soil, it has been
nown to attain the
height of from 60 st.

in such situations,
with 8 trunlt of pro-

sia, Pallas observes,
the bircb is tall and erect, with a trunk not very thick3 in the groves, the
trunk is thicker, 8ηά the head more spreading; and, in the open fields, the
trunk is short, the head broader than it is high, 8ηά the branches tor-
tuous. The trunk is, in gener-al, straight 8ηά cylindrioal, without deformities
8ηά linots. The cuticle is white aud scaly in trees from ten to thirteen
years of 3 but in old trees the trunk is covered with deep black clefts
in its wege The branches proceed chiefly from the summit, 8ηά are alter-
nate, frequently subdivided, νᾝ pliant 8ηά flexible, 8ηά covered with a
reddish brown oi· russet-colour smooth barli, which, as well as the buds,
is sl’ litly impregnated with a resinous substance. Both the trunk 8ηά
braii es are occasionally subject to the production of excrescences3 the
former as large knots, 8ηά the latter as twiggy tufts resembling large birds’
nests. These twiggy tufts are seldom found on the weeping variety, 8ηά
abound most on trees of the common sort growing on boggyOsoil. They
are most probably formed by the extravasation of the sap, occasioned by the

on the ends of the twigs, but do not expand their flowers til the female cat-
kins appear in sprin . On young trees, 8ηά on old trees in particular situ-
ations, especially in p boggy soil, the branches are erect3 but in old trees,
8ηά in some young ones more than in others, they are pendulous, 8ηά hence
the variety of that name. The roots extend themselves horizontally, 8ηά
divide into a great number of rootlets 8ηά hair-like fibres at their extremities3
but they never throvv up suckers. The rate of growth is considerable when
the tree is young3 averaging from 18 in. to 2st. a year for the first 10 ears;
and young trees cut down to the ground often make shoots 8 ft. or io long
