rer has not identified, in Eng. ot. suppl„ this with the Scottish
kind3 hence it becomes right to register it separately. The fol-
lowing notice of it is derived from Smith Eng. FI. .·— Μ. Devall
sent 8 specimen of the kind to Smith, in 1790, from Switzerland.
This specimen, when shown to Professor Mertens‚ was ronounced
by him to be of the S. phylicifolin of Willdenow 8ηά 01 er German
botanists. “ It is not, however, that of Linnaeus, nor, apparently,
that of Wshlenberg.” It agrees with the female of the Scottish
lkind, ἰῗέοορι thet the ovary, and au parts of the catkin, are much
ess s y.
