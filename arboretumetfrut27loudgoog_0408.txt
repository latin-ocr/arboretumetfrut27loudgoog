shoots and leaves had been protruded from this

plant, and been blackened by frost3 while in P

tremula and P. canadensis the leaf buds were most

of them unchanged from their appearance in winter..

Michaux states that, in America, the American

aspen blossoms about the 2oth of April, and that

the leaves appear in ten days or a fortnight after-

wards. He describes the leaves as small when

pendulouS, and protruded from the extremity of the ⁴

shoots. The bracteas of the male flowers are of a

dark chestnut colour, but are srin ed with white

hairs. The perianth is white. T e anthers are

numerous, and deep brown3 the pollen is white

The bark is smooth. The wood, according to Bige-

low, is light, fine, sost, and perishable3 and the

bark is used as a febris e. In the United States, it is scarcely applied to

any useful .purpose; t ough Michaux was informed that it had been

successfully divided into very thin laminae, for the fabrication of women's

hats3 and that these hats were, for a short time, fashionable in several

towns of the United States· Among the Cree Indians, the wood is esteemed

to burn better, in a green state, than that of any other tree in the country.

(Franklin’s first Joum, p. 753.) ln Britain, this tree is in several col-

surfaces3 the petiole compressed in the terminal part3 the disk roundish-
ovate, acute, sinuately toothed with large unequal teeth. (Pus-sk and
Mela. sen.) Wild in Canada, and a
tree, 4oft. or 50 ft. high, with a trunk
10 in. or lain. in diameter. The full-
formed disk of the leaf is nearly round,

P. ndidentata is occasionally met with

“ in t e American woods, but is much less
common than P. trepida. It is easily
distinguished from the various cultivated

ὁ kinds of poplar, by the lar unequal
indentations of the margins o the leaves.
The leaves, as Michaux observes, are
covered, when young, with a white down,
which disappear's as they ow older. ln

' many instances, the di is furnished ¹
with a pair of glands at the base. The 4
catkins appear in May, and are 2in. or 4
