mising that this author inc udes both Juglans and Garga under the genus
Juglans3 the genus Garya, as we have seen m the nenc characters above,
having been separated from Ju ans by Nuttall, chie y on account of a tech-
nical distinction in the fruit. “ he walnuts of North America‚’' Michaux ob-

eerves, ‘⁶ appear to resent characters so distinct, as to uire their division ·

into two sections. hese characters consist prin ⁸ ly in e form of the bar-
ren aments, or male catkins3 and in the greater or essrapidity ofgrowth in the
trees. The first section is composed of walnuts with single amenta, and in-
cludes two American species: the black walnut (Juglans nigra L„ fig.1260. in
p.14-36. ‚ and the butter-nut J. cinerea L„ fig.1262. in p.14·39.); to which is
added e European walnut J. regia L.. fig. 1257. in p. 1425.). The second
section consists of such as have compound aments, and comprises eight spc-
cies: the paeane-nat hickory (Garya olivoeformis Nau„ fig. 1263. in p.1442.),
the bitter-nut hickor (C. amara Nau„ fig. 1264. in p. 1443), water bitter-
nut hickory (C. aqultiea Nati„ fig. 1265. ἰιι p. 1444), amciter-unt hickory
(C. tomentosa Nun„ fig. 1267. in p. 1445), shell-bark hickory (0. alba
Nau„ flg. 1269. in p. 1446), thick shell-bark hickory (C'. sulcata Nau„
fig. 1271. in p.1449.), pig-nut hickory (C. rcina Nun„ fig. 1273. in p.1460.),
and nutmeg hickory (G. myristicaeformis ult„ fig. 1275. ἱιι ρ.1451.). The first
three species os the second section bear some relation to those of the first
in their buds, which are not covered with scales. For this reason, 1 have
them immediately next, beginning with the paeane-unt hickory, which,

y its numerous leaflets, most nearly resembles the black walnut and the
butter-nut, the buds of which are also uncovered. Throughout the United
States, the common name of hickory is given to all the species os the second
section. This common appellatio-1 is due ιο certain properties of their
wood; viz. coarseness of grain, aad a reddish colour ιιι the beart-wood,
which, however modified, are possessed by thern all, in a greater degree than
by any other tree of Europe or Amet-ica. These species exhibit, also, a
striking analogy in their forms and in their leaves, tho they differ in the
number and aize of their leaflets. To these sources o confiision must be
added another in the fruit, which is osten so various in its appearance, that it
is easy to mistake the species to which it belongs. 1t is not, then, on the
most remarkable differences alone that our distinctions must be founded3
recourse must also be had ιο an examination of the shoots of the preceding
year, οξ the buds, and of the amentsss’ (Maeli-r. North Aruer.. Sylva, vol. ι.
