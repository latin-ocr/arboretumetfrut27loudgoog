6 st. stom the ground, leaving the soil with the name inclination ae the trellis,
a tree trained on it would receive the aolar influence to great advantage,
and would probably ripen its fruit much better than a standard? (Hor-e.
Tnms„ sce.) When the mulberry is trained against a wall, end required to
produce very large and fine fruit, the followin mode of pruning is recom-
mended by Mr. Williams:—“ All the ann shoots, except the soreright,
are neatly trained to the wall3 but these last must be lest to grovv till towards
midsummer, and then be shortened about one third os their growth, to admit
light to the leaves benenth. By the end of August, the foreright ahoots will
have advanced ἠ, ao aa to obstruet the light, and they must then be short-
ened nearer to t e wall than before. In the mouth of March or beginning of
April, the ends of the terminal shoots should be pruned away down to the first
strong bud that doea not stand sorel-ightg and the-frent shoots, which were
pruned in August, must also be shortened down to two or three e ee. 1f
trained aster this method‚ the tree will afford fruit the third year. e fore-
right shoots should then be shortened at the end of the month of June, or
beginning of July, so aa to leave one leaf only be ond the fruit3 the terminal
shoota being nailed to the wall as before, an lest without an summer
pruning3 the f ⁸ t shoom, thus nailed, will not advenee any guber, aa
their nutriment ⁶ go into the fruit ς which, when quite ripe, will become
perfectly blank, very large,and highly zacchariae? (Ibid.) Aa a standard tree‚
