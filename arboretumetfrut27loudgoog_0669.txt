in or before 1699, b the Duchess of Beaufort3 and, being readily pro·
pagated by acorna, vv ‘ch are received from France and Spain, and some-
times ripened in England, it is not unfrequent in collectione ς and, in some
gardens, it forms a very handsome tree-

Voeietier. These, we have no doubt, are aa numerous aa the varietiee of Q.
Flex, in countriee where the tree is indigenous. None are in cultivation
in British gardens under any particular name ε but their leaves, in different
placeS, the cork trees having been all raised from seed, wiu be found to vary
in magnitude, in length relativcly to breadth‚ and in the character os their
margins, which are either wavy, sci-rate, or dentale, The most striking
variety which we have seen is at Muswell Hiu, and is represented at fig.

the species, that some consider it as Q. Pseu o-Snberz but that species,
according to Bone, the Nouveau Du Hamel, and the planta in the Horticul-
