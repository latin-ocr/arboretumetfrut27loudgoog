an arrow, shot by Sir Walter Tyrrell at a stag, glanced and struck Κίος
william 11„ stirnamed Rufus, on the bremt, of which stroke he instantly
died, on the ed of August, 1100.” ‘⁸ King william 11. being thus alain,
was laid in a cart belonging to one Purkess, and drawn from hence to win-
chester, and buried in the cathedra! church os that city.” “ That the spot
where an event so memorable ha ed might not heoeafter be unknown,
this stonewas set up by John Lor Delaware, who has seen the tree growing
m this place.” (Gi-spine For-eet Saea„ i. . 167.) This stone was erected in
{7453 and it is said that, in the reign of (Eheu-les IL, the oak was paled round
by that monarch‘s comniand, in order to its presewation. This tree appears to
have blossomed at Christmas, like the Cadenham Oak, mentioned below.

The Cadenham Oak, about three miles from Lyndhurst, is another of the
remarkable trees of the New Forest. This tree, which buds ev year at-
Christmas, ‘u mentioned by vamdeu. ‘⁴ Having osten heard osezis oa.k,”
says Gilpin, “ 1 took a ride to see it ou the 29th of December, 1781. It was
pointed out to me amongmseveral other oak8, surrounded by a little forest
stream, winding round a oll on which they stood. 1t is a tall straight
plant, of no great age, and apparently vigorous, except that its to has been
mjured, from which several branches issue in the form of pollard s oots. It .
was entirely bare of leaves, as far as Ι could discern, when Isaw it, and un-
distinguishable from the other oaks in its neighbourhood3 except that its
berk seemed rather smoother‚ occasioned, 1 apprehended, only by frequent 1
climbing. Having had the account of its earl budding confirmed on the spot,
1 engaged one Michael Lawrenee,who kept e white Hart,a small alehouse
in the 'mgb bourhood, to send me some os the leaves to Vicar’s Hill as soon
as s ould appear. Τὴε man, who had not the least doubt about the
matter, kept his word, and sent me several twigs on the 5th of January, 1782,
a few hours aster they had been gathered. The leaves were fairly ex ded,
and about lin. in length. From some of the buds two leaves had uns eathed
themselves, but, in eral, 00ῗέ one.'' (For. Scene„ i. p. 171.) One of t‘ne

of commg early into leaf had been communicated to its offspring. “ The
early apri of the Cadenham Oak? Gilpin continues, “ is of very short du·
ration. ’ἷξε buds, after unfolding themselves, make no fiirther progress, but
immediate} shrink from the season, and die. The tree oontmues torptd, like
other ‘ uous trees, during the remainder of the winter, and vegetates

'n in the spring, at the usual season.” When “ in full leaf in the middle
o summer, it appeared, both in its form and foliage, exactly like other oaks.”
(Iba, p. 174.) Another tree, with the same property of early germination,
has been found near the spot where Rufus’s monument stands. This seems
to authenticate Camden's account of the death of that rince3 for he speaks
of the premature vegetation os the tree against w 'ch Tyrrell’s arrow
aliemgfess find this may be one of its descendants. (See camden’e demunt ‘ff

The Bentl >Oak in Holt Forest, according to a letter from R. Marsham,
Esq„ in the ath Society'e Paper-e, was, in 1759, 34st. in circumference at
7 ft. from the ground, and was found, 20 ears afterwards (viz. in 1778), ιο
have increased only half an inch. Mr. {ssmham accounts for taking the
measure so far from the ground, by mentioning that there was an excres-
cence about 5 ft. or 6 a. high,'which would have rendered the measure unfair.
At Beaulieu Abbey, Gilpin observes, there was, some years ago, “ a very
extraordinary instance of v ‘on. The main stem of an oak arose in
contact with a p'art of the w l, which was entire, and extended one of ita
principal limbs along the summit of it. This limb, at the distance of a few
yards from the pment tree, findin a fissure in the wall, in which there might

ly be some deposit of soi, shot a root through it into the earth.
ence shooting up again through another art of the wall, it formed a new

stem, as large as the original tree3 ³2⁶ ἥξοι t is proceeded another horizontal
