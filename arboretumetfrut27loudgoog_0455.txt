In these laces, Maupertuis found aa many trees blown down as stan ⁴ He
examin several of them, and was surprised to see that, in such as “ lain
lo , the substance of the wood was entirely ne, but the bark remained 8
hol ow trunk, without an signs of decay· {oGibphz's Forest Scenery, vol. i.
p. 71.) In the mines of Bworetzkoh in Siberis, 8 piece of birch wood was
found changed entirely into stone3 while the epidermis of the bark, of 8 satiny
whiteness, and shining, was exactly in its natural state, erfectly well pre-
served, and without being coloured by the iron. It woufd be difficult, says
the relater of this fact in the Nouveaa Du Hamel, to find a more striking proof
of the durability of this thin llicle, so light and so delicate in appearance, and
which the ancients used with’eso much pro riety instead of paper, before the
invention of that material. The buds and eavea, in early spring, abound in
a resinous matter, an aromatic and le fragrance from which may be

perceived at a considerable distance om the tree3 and the leaves, when

bruised, whether in a recent or dried state, are also bitter and aroma- ⁶

tic. The wood is employed by wheelwrights, in France, for the felloes
of wheels3 and, in the interior of Russia, in the construction of small rustic
carriages: the felloes of tbe wheels are sometimes made of one entire stem
of a young birch tree, bent by heat, and retained in its place by ties of the

the birch is of little use till it has attained the age of sixty or eight γεω-ες at
which it is little liable to w , or to be attacked b worms. T e tree oc-
casio y produces knots of a dish tinge, marbled, ight, and solid, but not
fibrous3 and of these, which are much sought after b turners,cups and bowls
are made by the Laplanders with their knives. The young shoots and
brancbes make hoops, brooms or besoms, and ties for faggots, baskets, wicker
hurdles, and other p ses to which the hazel or the basket-willow is ap-
plied; and, when peelfflffo are used for making wbisks for frothing up syllabubs,

ln Poland, Bassia, Sweden, Non-way, and land, small bundles of the
twigs, which have been gathered in summer, 8ηά 'ed with the leaves on, are ·
used in the vapour—baths, by the bathers, for beating one another's backs, in
