and the plate of this tree in our last Volume. —This is a hand·
some tree, resembling in general form the Lombardy plar. It
is found in the valleys of the western Pyrenees, and in t e Laudes,
near Bordeaux, though but sparingly. According to Jaume Saint-
Hilaire (Mb der Arb. Fon), though it is found in the Pyrenees,
the Basse Navarre‚ and the neighbourhood os Bordeaux, it is
thought to be originally from Portugal. Oapt. S. E. Cook found
it in the Pyrenea, in the line to Bayonue, but rarely. He describes
it as havin a trunk rising only a little way above the roots, and
then opreaffing into a head composed of small brancha, as nu-

men landscape; in our opinion an error in taste which he has
fallen into from the novelty of its form in the oak family, since it is
without either the grandem· or the beauty of the common species. In
the Nouveau Du Hamet, a tree of this variety is mentioned‚which had
been sownin 1790 3 and, tho h itwastwice afterwards tmns lanted,
was‚in 1819, upwards of 40 . high. There are planta at essrs.
