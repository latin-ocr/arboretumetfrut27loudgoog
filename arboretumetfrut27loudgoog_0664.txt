which we suspect it is. Bosc observes that, in the Paris gardens, it 'res
tobe taken into the conservatory in winter: but it is to be recoll that
the Q. Ι *lex requires similar protection in that part of France3 and, there-
fore, there can be little doubt but Q. Balatu, if it is different from Q.
gramfintia, would be hardy in the neighbourhood of London.
