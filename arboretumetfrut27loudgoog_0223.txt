soil pressed firmly to it, more especially at its lower extrahity. 'flue reason
why the lower end of the cutting is cut directly across, and not sloping like
the upper end, is, that it may form an uel callosity all round it, and, con-
sequenti , throw out an equal number o roots from that callosity on every
side.. Ίῖοε reason why the cuttingisploeedupright inthatherooumnybe

the lower end, and partly from the side. It is found from expertenee, that,
when a cutting is put in in a sloping direction, roots are protruded nearly
equally through all that part that is buried in the ground, unless the soil has
boen more closely pressed “ ι one part than another3 in which ease
the roots will there be protr in greater abundaneeg and, if the soil has
notbeen pressed to the lower extremity, it will probably produce no root·
at all there, but rot. The upper extremity of the cutting ts cut in a slop‘
directiom merely to throw off the rain. When willows are to be plan
where they are finally to remain, cutt‘ may be made of the two-ymold
wood, about 2ft. long, and cut in a soping direction at both ends. The
advantages of choosing the two-years-old wood is, that the plants uced
are more vigorem, which is not always desirable in plants that are to trans-
planted, on account of their greater bulk, and the consequent expense of
their removal. The cuttings of the two-years·old wood should be inserted
in the ground, either by means of an iron-pointed dibber, or merely by ⁸

willows is suade in a grassy sui-face on the banks of rivers or streame. Cut-
tings of the smaller kinds of willows, and especially of those kinds which are
somewhat difficult to strike‚ should be lanted in a sandy soil, in a shady
situation, and kept moist. The few t at are extremely difficult to strike
should have their cuttings formed of the growing wood with the leaves on}
and, after being planted in saud, they should be covered with a hand-glass.
The best season for puttin in cuttings of the winter's wood is the autumn,
in consequence of which t e buds swell ‹lurin the winter, and are ready to
grow with vigour in the spring; but in wet soi , and in climates where they
are liable to be loosened by the frost in the winter senson, cuttings planted in
autumn ought to be made firm a second time in the spring.

The principa} willow which propagates itself by seeds in Euro is the S.
caprea, and its ve numerous allied kinds. The seeds are small an black, and
enveloped in a tu t of cottony matter. They are ri in May, or early in
June3 and they are speedily dispersed by the win . If they fall in soil
moist and shaded from the suu, or if a heavy shower of rain happen soon
afterwards, they will spring up in three weeks, and produce plant· 3in. or
4in. hi before the end of the season. In Franoe, Bosc informs us, this
kind ο willow is sometimes raised from seed, in the government nurseries,
for transplantation into the national forests ς and all that it requires is, to be
sown on an even surface‚ well watered, and very slightly covered with loose
litter. We are not aware of the willow havin ever been grasted, though we
think very curious and beautiful planta mig t be formed by grafting the
trailing sorts standard high, or by graftinga number of sorts on one tree.
