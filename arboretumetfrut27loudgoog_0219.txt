shoots of willows of certain vigorous-growin kinds, when cut down to the

The useayof the entire plant are various. Almoat all the species being
aquatioe, and of rapid and vigoroua growth‚ they are peculiarly fitted for
planting on the banke of rivers and streams, for restrainmg their encroach-

from being also aquatica, and having numerous roots, are, no doubt, adapted for
this purpose, such aa tbe aldem but the willow has this great advantage, that
it grows readily by cuttings, and, therefore, does not require the soil to be dis-

most advantage are, S. alba, S. Russellia'na, S. fragilia, S. caprea, and some
others, which we have enumerated under the head of Culture. The trees
which are most ornamental are, the well-known S. babylonica, S. alba maa, S.
