nearly covered with wood, consisting rincipelly of onk trees3 and Fitzctephen
tells us theta large forent lay round ondon, “ in the coverte whereof, lurked
bucks end doec, wild bom and bulls.'’ As civilisntion advnnced‚ thece woods
became partiauy cleared away-3 and thone which remained were called the
Royal Pol-eota, and were returned for tbe purpose of sbeltering geme for the
diversion of the king-s. Henry 11. gave a right ιο the Cistercinn Abbey of
Flnxley, in the neighbourhood of the Forest of Denn, ιο erect nn iron forge,
together with libert to cut two onk trees weekly‚ ιο supply it with fuel. But
Henry 111. revok this latter grant, ns being ‘udicial ιο the forest 3 and n
wood‚cnlled theAbbot’sWood,was gifted ιο ο ebbeyin lieu ofit. (See
Lauder’s Gilpea, vol. ii. p. 67.) An inquisition wne held, in the reign of
Henry ΙΙ., roepecting Sherwood Foreet, by which it appears that the right of
hunting in it wne then considered of great unportnnce3 and an act wne passed,
in the reign of Henry 111. (1231), to define its boundariee. The Forat of
Saloe was also formerly one of great im ce, and it ie frequently men-
