This species is readily disti ished from the remaining ones be-
longing to this section (with e exception os S. incubacea), by its
very silvei-y leaves and upright mode of growth. Both sexes are
described ln Eng. Fc.; the female is figured in Sal. Wob. and Hayne
Abbild. There are plants at Woburn Abbey, Henfield, 8ηά Flitwick
House, and also in the Goldworth Arboretum.

Spec. Char„ ὅτι, ’Leaves obovate-lanceolate, partly opposite, acute, slightly
serrated, even ς lund and somewhat silky beneath. Snpules lmear. Branches
· erect. Catkins erect, cylindrical. Ovary stalked‚ silky, longer than the
obovate bearded bractea. (Smitk and Borrer.) Sent from

Scotland, as British, by the late Mr. George Don. It
flowers in May. Stem 5st. vor fist. high, with straight,
wand-like, round, leafy branches, of a reddish or rusty

or in some measure laucous, as well as finely downy or silky, beneath‚
with 8 prominent redflsh midrib, 8ηά slender veins ; the silkiness less evi-
dent on the older ones. Footstalks short, very broad at the base, paler
than the branches. Catkins of female flowers appear-ing before the
leaves, on short lateral stalks. (Smilla.) S. Donidna, in the female, which is
the only sex at present known to British botanists, assimilates to the kinds
of the group Purpureas, except S. rubra Huds„ in the aspect of the branches,
’ shoots, leaves, and catkins; in some of the leaves being opposite3 and in
the old bark being internally yellow, though less remarkably so than that of
these kinds3 but it differs from them in having its leaves silky beneath,
and its ovary stalked, and Mr. Borrer believes that, in the relation of
affinity, it is nearest to S. ffiscag but he notices that we are without the
means of proos, which the male flowers would afford. There are plants
{t {vooburn Abbey, Henfield, and Flitwick House, and in the Goldworth

r retum.
