iron wood, generally forme a tree about 30 st. high, grovgmg more rapndly
than O. vulgetis, and differing from thet species, aceo · to Willdenow
and Pursh, chiefly in the pontion of its fannle cethus, w ch are upnght,
instead os being pendulous. The tree‚ according
to Michauz is easily known, in winter, by ιιε
smooth greyish berk, which is finel divided, and
detached in strips of not more than a ‘nein ffleodth.

     

The wood is perfectly white, compact, fine-graiued, Q&

and very heevy. The concentrical layers are clffly ¹
compreeeed, and their number, in a trunk only ·
4in. or 5in. diameter, evinces the length of timp ., ,
