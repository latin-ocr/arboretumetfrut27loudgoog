tree was in a state of great decay. It had separated in the middle, and one

“ so hard, even in its putrid state, as to admit of a polish. Ϊ11 this ancient
Tor Wood it stands, in a manner, alone.” Compared to it, even the oldest
tree near it ‘⁴ is but of very modern date. The memory of its having saved
Wallace has, robably, been the means of its preservation, when all the rest of
