These two specie· are the only ones which produce eatable fruit. It is men·
tioned iu the Nomou Du Hamel, that the receptacle which forme the fruit of
the fig is not always entire and connivent; but,that there are some few sorta
in which the fruit constantly opens when it approaches maturity3 ‹lividing
ordinarily into four parts, which expand like the tals of a flower, to such
an extent, that each division become· perpendicu ar to the peduncle. The
varietiee which exhibit this singularity are called the Bamissotes and the
Verdales. (N. Du Ham„ tom. iv. 12:198„ note.)
