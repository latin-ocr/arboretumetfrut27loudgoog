to zoin. in diameter, yet rarely exhi-

bits a regular form: its trunk is gene-

rally crooked, and divided into several

thick limbs at 8ft.‚ 10 ft„ or l2ft. from

the ground. In American, Michaux tells

us, ‘⁴ upon old trunks the bark is thick,

and deeply furrowed3 that of the young

branches, on the contrary, is smooth,

and of a beautiful green colour. The

leaves are about 61¹1. long, alternate,

oval·acuminate, glaucone on the lower

sursum, and evergreen. When bruiscd

they diffuse a strong odour, resembling

that of the sweet bay (Laurus nobilis), 4 v

and may, like those of that species, be employed in cookery.’' (Mc-hx. North
Amer. Syl„ ii. p. 151.) The male flowers come out in lon hunches from the
axils of the leaves3 and the female flowers in loose bunc es on pretty long
red peduncles. The berries are of a dark rich blue‚ in red cups‚ and they
grow tw0, and sometimes three, together. The red ba is found m the lower
part of Virginis, audit continues in abundance throug out the maritime dis·
tricts of the carolinas, Geo ἐι, the two floridas, and Lower Louisiana.
Mixed with the sweet bay Rafirus nobilis), tupelo (Nyssa bidom), red
maple (fflcer rubrum), and water oak (Quercus natica , it fills the broad
swamps which intersect the pine barrens. A egil and umid soil appears
essential to its growth3 and lt is remarked, that the fai-ther south it grows,
the more vigorous and beautiful is its vegetation. It was discovered by
Catesby, and described and figured by him in his work on Carolina; Miller
cultivated it in 1739. 1n France, Plumier constituted it a genus, to which
he gave the name of Borbdnia in honour of Gaston de Bourbon‚ son of
Henry IV„ and uncle of Louis XIV. In America, the wood of the red
ba is used for cabinet-making, as it is very strong, and of a beautiful rose-
colom, has a fine compact grain, and is susceptible of a brilliant polisb,
having the appearance, as Catesby tells us, of watered satin. Before mahogany
became the reigning fashiou in cabinet-making, Michaux observes, the wood
of the red bay was commonly employed in the southern states of North
America by the cabinet-makers, who produced from it articles offurniture of
the highest d ee of beauty3 but trees of the red bay are now no longer to
be found in orth America of sufficient diameter for this purpose, and re-
course is had to mahogany, which is im rted from St. Domingo at a moderate
price. It might also be em loyed in s ip-building‚ and for other purposes of
construction, as it unites t e properties of strength and durability; but its
trunks are rarely found of sufficient dimensions to render it available for
these purposes. In En land it is solely considered as an ornamenta-l tree;
and as it is more ten er than the common sweet bay, it is only suitable for
warm or sheltered situations, or sor being placed against a wall.
