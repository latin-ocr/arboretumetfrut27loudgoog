The brancbes are long, smooth‚ round, shining, and coplousl covered with
smallyellow dots: the preceding year’s shoots are cover with a violet- ⁸
coloured powder‚ similar to that on the sboots os S. precox, and S. acutifolia.
The leaves are about 4in. long, and nearly lin. broad, tapering towards
both extremities, serrated3 the serratures somewbat glandulas, smooth, and
sbining on their u per surface, and cous underneath. Footstalks nearly

Stamens 3. Leaves lanceolate, approaching to ovate, serrated‚ glabrous,
having large, rounded, toothed, more or less decidnous, stipules. Flowers
loosely disposed in the eatkin. Pistil stalked. Ovary mostly glabrons.
Most of the kinds constitute excellent osiers, and become trees uf left to
themselves. (Hook. Br. ΓΑ, 2d ed„ with adaptation.) The kinds may be
denominated, generall , the osiers with 3 stamens in a ssower. Most, or all,
when in the state· larger shrubs and trees, bave their older bark ex-
folinted in broad patches, in the manner of that of the western and eastern
plane trees (Pinianus occidentalis L„ and P. orientnlis L.). Most or all
alil-e· oanamental as shrubs, for their lanceolate, glossy, serrated leaves, and
t en· owers.
