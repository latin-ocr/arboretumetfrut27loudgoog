verument plantatione of about 6000 acres of young trees have always, nomi-
nally at least, been kept up3 new pieces of ound being enclosed as the part
already planted became sufficiently advan to be thrown open to the forest.
An act passed in 1800 remedied many previouslyfexisting abuses3 and the ·
plantations are now in a ssourishing state. (See Part 1v.)

In Franee and Germany, the oak is one of the principa] traes that have
been subjected to cultivation3 and, in the oldest accounts on record respecting
artificial plantatione, the oak is mentioned as the object of especial attention.
In France it is more attended to than in Germany, 08 account of the fleet
which that country has essed for many centuries. The timber for the
French navy has not only or many centurias been obtained from the oaks in the

881, Β81, or Yiaoul, who was the Celtic god of fire, and was sometimes

- identified with the Suu, 8ηά was also worshipped under the form of an

oak. Baal was considered the same as the Roman Satura, and hisfestival
(that of Yule) was kept at Christmas, which was the time of the Satur-
nalia. The druids professed to maintaiu perpetual fire3 ,8ηά once every
year all the fires belonging to the ple were extinguished, and “

from the sacred fire of the drui s This was the origin of the ule
lo , with which, evea so lately as the commencement of the last century, the
C ' as fire, in some parts of the country, was always kindled3 a fresh log
being thrown on and lighted, hut taken off before it was consumed‚ and re-
served to kindle the Christmas fure of the following year. The Yule log was
always of oak3 and, as the ancient Britons believed that it was 8888811111 for
their hearth fires to be renewed every year from the sacred fire of the
druids, so their descendants tho t that some missortune would befall them
if any ,accident ha pened to the ule log. See Ι ’ s Braeebn'dge Hau.)
The worship of e druids was generally ormed un er an oak; and a heap
of stones was erected, on which the sacred fire was kindled, which was called
a cairn, as Professor Burnet says, from kern, 88 acorn. The mistletoe was
held in great reverence3 and, as it was not common on the oak, solemn cere-
monies attended the search for it. The druids fasted for several days, and
offered sacrifices in wicker baskets or frames ς which, however, were not made
of willow, but of oak twigs, curiously interwoven3 and were similar to that
still carried by Jack in the Green 08 May-da , which, according to Professor
Burnet, is one of the relies of druidism. hen all was prepared for the
search (the mistletoe having been, no doubt, previously found by some of the
assistants), the druids went forth, clad 18 white robes, to search for the sacred
plant 3 and, when it was discovered, one of the dniids ascended the tree, and
gathered it with great ceremony, separating it from the oak with a golden
knife. The mistletoe was always cut at a particular of· the moon, at the
beginning of the year, and with ,the ceremomes already etailed under the head
of Viscum see p. 1022.); and it was only sought for when the druids had
had visions ‘recting them to seek it. When a great length of time elapsed
without this happening, or ,if the mistletoe chanced to fall to the ground, it
