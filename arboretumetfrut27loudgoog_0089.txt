Desa-iption, dc. This genus consists of milky plants, most of which sre herb-
aceous, but two or three os which sre rather woody. The flowers of the hardy
kinds are generally of a greenish colour, which renders them inconspicuous;
and they have all sn extremely ncrid juice, which has the appearance of milk.
This juiee was formerly considered medicinsl‚ and is still used occasionaellly go

division. The only two worth cultivating, ss shrubby‚ appear
to us to be the E. C'hardciss L. sud E. spinosa L.

its foliage, and purplish brown in the barff
which are mostly unbranched. The ssowers sre in stslked
penicles a few in esch pauide, and the penicles are disposed
rneernosely along the upper portions of the shoots. The
more obviously coloured of the inflorescence is of a dsrk

purple. The scent of e flowers is powerfully fetid and ι
dissgreesble. The plant, in s sheltered nook, under a wall,
will atteia to the height of 3 ft. or more (in Martyn’s Mller,
5ft. or 6st.); and is interesting, even when not in flower,
from its being evergreen‚ and from the character of its fo-
liage5 the leaves being lanceolste, acute, entire, downy, dark
green, and spreeding every way. (Smith Eng. Π, sud obser-

the July os that year, in a w belonging to John Perry, Esq.,

E. :pendeo Ιιι, sts. Dend. Brit„ t. 45, and our fig. 1209.— A ᾗ
leafy, shrubby plant: snstive of the south of Europe; generally
kept in grem-hom in Britain, where it muman the character *
of nn erect shrub‚ about 2 ft. high, with a decidedly ligneous
stem. The tips of the branches become dry with age, and as,
though withered, they continue on the plant, they have the sp-
pearanee of spine·- It was cultivated by Miller, in 1752, but is
rare in British collectione. In the open air, in the Botsnic
Garden st Cambridge, it is a recumbent shrub. It is not easily
propagated by cuttings made in the common way, but is said to 1213
