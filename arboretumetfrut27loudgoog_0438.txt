America3 in the interior of Canada, and on the north-west coast. The alder
was known to Homer and Theophrastus. (See p. 18.) According ιο Vns-gil,
it formed the first material for boats3 and Lucan recommends it as a wood

Crete3 but it may be doubted whether he alludes to the same trec. In the
time of Theophrastus, the bark was used for dyeing leather; and, in the da s
of Pliny, the wood was employed for piles, which he calls “ eternal ;’' and or

at Venice, was built ou p' es of this tree. It is still extensively usedin
Flanders and Holland, sor the purpose of forming piles. Boutcher‚ wrmng
in 1780, informs us that, between 1730 and 1750, “vast quantities of alder
planta were brought from Holland to Scotl'and, at a considerable price, and
unhappily for the ownem’, anted in large tracts of moist land, from which
no returns suitable ιο the ιιι· and expense had been received.” He adds
