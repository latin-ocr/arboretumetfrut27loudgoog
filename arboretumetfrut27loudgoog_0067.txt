(Smith Eng. Flora„ ii. p. 229.) An ever-
shrub3 a native of Britain, and mont
other parts of Europe, in wood53 growing to
the height of 3st. or 4ft.‚ and producing ita
yeuowish green flevere, which are disposed in
clusters of 5 each, soon aster Christmoe, if ξ
the westher be not very severe, and continuing
flowering till March. Though not showy in
its flowers, it is a valuable plant for a obrub-
bery, from its being evei-green, and from its
thick, glmy, shining leaves being disposed in
tusts at the ends of the brancha, so as to give it a full bushy appear-
auce ς which has a d effect in plantatione, where it is desirable to pro-
duce masses of dar green. It thrives best in the shade, and will flourish
in sitimtions under the drip of trees, where few other planta would grow.
