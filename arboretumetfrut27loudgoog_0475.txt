Description. The oaks are trees of temperate climates, mostly of large

defensive, trees of civilised society, in the temperate³ r ’ons throughout
the world. The oak, both in Europe and America, is t e most majestic
of forest trees. It has been represented by Mau-quis (Reos. Hira, διο.)
as holding the same rank amon the plants of the temperate hemispheres
that the lion does among qu rupeds, and the eagle among birds3 that
is to say, it is the emblem of grandem, strength, and duration3 of force that
resists, as the lion is of force that acts. In short, its bulk, its longevity, and
the extraordinary strength and durability of its timber, attest its su 'ority
over all other trees, for buildings that are intended to be of reat uration,
and for the construction of ships. In one word, it is the {ing of forest
trees. The trunk of the oak is not, in net-al, remarkable either for its
length, straightness, or freedom from branc es, except when it is drawn up
among other trees. In an o n situation, the larger species send out nu-
merous very horizonta} Janches, so as to form a head broader than the

root of the oak, in most species, descends erpendicularly to 8 considerable
depth, unless the subsoil be unpropitious: Eut it also extends horizontally as
widely as the branches ς thus taking a firmer hold of the ground than any other
trec, with the exception, perhaps, of the walnut, and one or two others. The
surface roots, in only one or two species, throw up suckers. The leaves vary
in different sections of the genus. ln what are called oaks by way of eml-
nence, such as Quercus Robur, Q. rubra, and Q. Certis, which may be con·
sidered as the heads of three great families, they arc of a shape which is rarely,
if at all, to be found in any other genus of plants. The lanceolate leaves of
the willow, the cordate leaves of the poplar, and the pinnate leaves of the
ash or the acacia, are to be found in many genera3 but notso the lobed
and sinuated leaves of the oaks of the three sections above mentioned. In
other sections, such as that represented by Q. Phellos and Q. Flex, the leaves
are entire, aud may be considered as exhibiting commonplace forms. In
most of the species, and especially in the larger trees, the leaves are deci-
duous ; but in some sections, as in Q. Plex and Q. virenS, they are everfireen.
The flowers are in all inconspicuous, without corollas, and, in gene , a
pearing with, or before, the leaves. The female flowers are, as in· most amen-

This fruit is as distinct in its character and ap rance from all other fruita,
as the leaves of the common oaks are from al other leaves. The form and
