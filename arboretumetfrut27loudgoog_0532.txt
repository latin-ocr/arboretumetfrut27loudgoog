“ Our Lady of Peace.” Allonville is about a mile from Yvetot‚ on the road
between Rouen and Havre.

The following information we have received from our friend, the Abbe
Gosier of Rouen. In the first volume of the Archiae: ananelles de la Noa-
mandie‚ printed at Caen in 1824, there is an article on the oaks of Pom-net,
in which, aster mentioning that several of these oaks were of enormous size, the
following particulare are given of some of them :- The Goulande Oak near
Dourfront is about 30ft. m circumfer-enee. The two oaks of Mayior, in the
canton of Calvados, are of ver great size. The largest is above 4-2 st. in cir·
cumference at the surface of the ground, 3ηά above 30 ft. in circumfer-enee at
the height of 6 st. All these oaks have lost their leading shoots, and have
their trunks hollow. The oak called La Cave is a very remarkable tree. It
stands in the Forest ofBrothone. The trunk is sest. m circumference in its
smallest part3 it is hollow3 and at a few feet from the base it divides into five
large branches or rather trees, which rise to a considerable height. The
trunk stom which they spring has the appearance of a large goblet; it is
hollow, cup-shaped, covered w1th bark inside, and nearly always filled with
water, which is seldom less than 5st. d . “ 1 visited this tree,” says Μ.
Deshayes (who wrote the account which as been sent to us by the Abbe
Gosier), “on July soth, 1825, 3ηά, though it was a season of extraordinary
drou ht, 1 found the water in the tree was 2 st. 6 in. deep. Ῑ visited it some
montffis afterwards, and found the basin fullss’ At Bonnevaux is an oak, in
the hollow trunk of which there is a circular table, round which 20 persons
have sate to dinner. Letter from l’Abbe Gosier.)

An) immense oak was, in May, 1836, felled on the road from Vitre to
Fo eres. It was 22 ft. in circumference, had a straight trunk 30 st. long, and
weig ed &ato-ns. Ten pair of oxen and twenty horses were required to carry

Lar-{ge (Oak-s in Geivnany. The ancient Germans, history informs us, had -
oak castles. In the hollow of one, we read that a hermit built his cell and
chape13 and of some oaks of almost incredible bulk, which Evelyn says in
his time were “ lately standing in westphalia,” one was 130 ft. high, 3ηά re- '
ported to be 30 st. in diameter3 another yielded 100 loads of timber3 and 3
third “ served both for a castle and a fort.” (Amoen. Quer.) The following
extract is from G 's Four Bookes ofHusbandrie (1586) :-“ We have at
this day an oke in estphalia‚ not far from the Castle of Alsenan, which is
from the foote to the neerest bowe, one hundred and thirtie foote, and three
elles in thickness3 and another, in another place, that, being cutte out, made
a hundred waine load. Not farre from this place there ew an other oke of
tenne yardes in thicknesse, but not very hie? (p 101. ὃς

Having now given what may be considered a count biography of cele-
brated British calta, and enumerated a few remarkable oreign ones, we shall
next collect together, without reference to locality, the names of a few re·
markable for some peculiarity in their trunks or branches ς in their origin3 the
trees with which they grow ς for the quantity of timber they have produced,
or their rate of growth3 3ηά which, for the sake of distinction, may be called

Oaks remarkable fin· their Age. ‘⁸ If we consider,” says Marshall (Plani. aad
Bur. Orn.) “ the quick growth of the chestnut, compared with that of the oak,
and, at the same time, the inferior bulk of thetrunk of the Tortworth Chestnut
to that of the trunk of the Cowthorpe, the Bentley, or the Doddington Oak,
may we not venture to infer that the existence of these truly venei-able trees
