‘ ed in the different species. Whoever has seen au acorn of the common
ritish oak would be at uo loss to detect an oak of any species whatever,
provided he saw its fruit3 whereas iu the case of many genera, such as .
Pyrus, for example, no man, not a botanist, who had seen an apple or a pear,
would recoguise as species of the same genus those trees which bore fruit
like the mountain ash. In short, the genus Quercus may he as easily detected
at first sight by its fruit, as the Abietiuae or the Leguminosae are by theirs.
The acorns of different species differ chiefly in the largeness or smallness,
ro hness or smoothness, of their calyx, or cup; and in their bein sessile or
s ed. Iu ernl, the oaks of Europe have stalked fruit, and e oaks of
America seggffgn fruit. The fruit of most of the species atteias maturity in
one year3 but in some two years are required. In all, the vital rinciple is
hut of short duratiou3 aud very few acorns, of any species, wid) germinate
after having been kept a year. The rate of owth of the“oak is, in most
species, considered slow3 though this is not e case when it is planted ou
suitable soil. The most rapid-growing European species is the Q. Ger-ris,
and of the American species, in America, the Q. alba. The highes rowing

The gen height of what are considered large British oaks varies from eost.
to soft.; aud large American oaks, from 70 st. to 90st. The smallest Eu-
ropean oak is the Q. humilis, which is seldom found higher than ast. or 4 st..
and, according to Marquis, is often in the Laudes, near Bordeaux, not more
than lst. high when it has attaiued its full growth; and the smallest American
oak is Q. pumila, which is seldom‚ if ever, h· her than 20 in. in a wild state.
The-oak which attains the greatest maguitu e is Q. pedunculata3 and this

oak attains to maturity in much less time than a century. There are, also,
few trees which, when raised stom seed, are so long in producing stuit ς
though there are some exceptions among the Europeau oaks; and Q.
lanata, a native of Nepal, we have seen in a pot, bearing acorna, at the
of three or four years. ln general, however, the oaks that attain the aize
{ieiurge trees do not produce fruit tin they are between 15 aud 18 years
old. Like most other trees, the oak seldom bears an abundant crop os
fruit for two years in suecessiom audit increases iu roductiveness with age.
All the species of oak gigsh up shoots from the co when cut down, but
only one or two species ru the root. In North America, Michaux observes,
dwarf, stoloniferous, or creeping oaks occur, the multiplied shoots of which '
cover immense tracta of land. The meadows situated in the midst of the
foresta of Amet-ica are bumed annually, either by the Indians or the settlers3
who endeavour by this practice to produce a new herbage, not only with a view
of feedin their cattle ou it, but to attract fawus and other animala from the
foresta. ιι ’ these annual co tious, the trees osten take fire, aud
whole vacanti} forest are destroye . The roots of the trees, however,
generally remain unnnjured5 and those of the oaks, which spread hori-
zontally‚ frequently send up shoots which produce acorns, when only two
or three feet above the ground. These miniature oaks have been found by
travellers‚ who, unable otherwise to account for their appearance, have
fancied them distinct species; but as their acorna, when sown, Michaux ob-
serves, “ have produced a taproot, like common acorns, without suckers or
stoloniferous roots, it is not likely that there are any oaks in America
which have naturally trailiug stems.’' {ku des Che'nes, p. 5.) We have
observed above, that oaks are general y considered of slow growth3 but
this chiefly ap lies to young plauts, and as compared with the rate of growth
of soft-wood trees. After oaks have stood in good soil, and a suitable
climate, for five or six years, the grow with rapidity till they have at-
tained the age of 30 or 40 years, a ter which, most of the species live, and
continue to increase in siae, sor centuries. The life of some species of
oak extends to upwards of 1000 years. There are some oaks iu Britain
