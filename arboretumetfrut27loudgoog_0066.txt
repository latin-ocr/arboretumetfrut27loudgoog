Description,6·c. The mezereon is a well-known shrub, much valued in

our gardens and shrubberies for the beauty both of its flowers and fruit. It

roduces its agreeably fragrant flowers in February or March, before the

The whole shrub is poisonous to human beings‚
though the berries are a favourite sood for finches,
and other birds, more especially.the robin. The
bark is powerfully acrid: it is used in France for
forming setons or slight blisters, and is very effica-
cious in cases where lt is thought desirable to pro-
duce a slight serous dischar e, without raising a
large blister. When either tge bark or berries are
chewed, they produce violent and long-continued
heat and irritation in the mouth and throat. The
mezereon is sometimes used in medicine3 but it , ..

uires to be administered by a skilful hand. x Χ. '‘-

to vegetate very soon aster Christmas. It thrives most in a loamy soil, and
in an open situation 3 and, when it is roperly treated, and has room, it will
