1f exposed to the sun, the leaves turn beck with a kind of twist ς and, instead
of their natural pure deep green, they assume a brownish tinge. The ber-
ries are oval, green at first, but black when ripe3 and they are a favourite
sood of singing birds: though, as De Candolle observes in the Flore Run-
pm'se, they are poisonous to all other animale. The spurge laurel is propa-
gated by seeds, like the mezereon ;but‚ as they will remam two years in the

und before the vegente, they are generally treated like haws‚ and kept
or some time in e rotting-h . It may also be propagated by cuttings;
but not readily. Itis much 33313 nurseriee, as a stock on which to grast
the more tender species of the genus3 but aa, like all the other daphnes, it
has few roots, it requires to be transplanted with care.

the Black Sea, on hilis and in woods; and Pallas
says that it is also found in Siberia,in thick woods‚
and in the valleys which occur between the ridges
of loft‘y mountains. Itis, generally speaking, sufficiently hardy to bear the win-

its young shoots very early, they are osten injured in exposed situations, by the
