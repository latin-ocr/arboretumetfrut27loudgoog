jun.,and obs.) A tree, a native of North America, and in Dahuria and
Altai. It was cultivated in England as early aa 1692, in the Ro al Gardens
at Hampton Court. (Ait. Hoc-t. Kew.) It flowers in Marc , in North
America ἦεν-θὴς in April, in England (Ait. Hert. Keaev.); and the
female, in ahuna, in May. (Pallas.) In the climate of London, accordi -
to Miller, the male flowers come out in long catkins in April and May, an
fall off soon after: their stamens are numerous, irregular in height, and
crowned with bearded anthera of a purple colour. The hermaphrodite
flowera are produced at the end of the shoots, upon long alender peduncles,
in very loose catkina, having a leaf involucre under each, which is oval
and entire; and from the bosom of that arises the peduncle, which is very
short. Upon the to is placed the petal, or calyx (or nectary, according
to Linnoeus), ahaped ' e a wide cup, having a style in the centre‚ and two
stamens on one side, terminated by p idal purple anthera. The female

flowera are succeeded by oval capsu ea, termmating in a point, and en-
closing downy seeds. (Mart. Mill.)
