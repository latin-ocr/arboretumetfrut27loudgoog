Near this spot, tradition says, were auciently some old oaks, under which
the Britons held their courts of judicature previously to the invasion of the
Romans3 8ηά under which the conference between the Saxona 8ηά the Britons
took place, after which the latter gave up the kingdom, and retired into
Wales. The oak trees, though the place is still called Wistman’s, or Welch·
man's‚ Wood, have long since been cut down, though there are still some
huge gnarled stumps amidstloose rocks of franite ς 8ηά 08 their deeayed tops,
thorus, brambles, &c., are sbooting forth, ormin altogether a most tesque
appearance. (See Mart. Mill„ art. woodo.) hese distorted anffitunted
remains, we are informed by Mr. Borrer‚ are 811 Q. pedunculata 3 and some
idea may be formed of their apXearance from the engraving given of them by
Burt, in his notes to the secon edition of Cart-inglun’e Dav-tmoor. The trees
in this wood are now none of them above ‘'lst. high, though their trunks are
more than 10 ft. in circumference. For the followin account of this remark-
able wood we are indebted to W. Borrer, E . :—“ istman’s Wood is still
in existence. Itis something more than 8 8 north of Two-Bridges, near
the centre of Dartmoor, where it forms 8 narrow stri , a quarter of a mile at
least in length, along the western slope of 8 hill, at t e foot of which runs 8
mountain brook‚ one of the branches of the West Dart. On the ridge of
the hill are the Little Bee and the two Longaford Tors (the Great Longaford
being 8 building-place of the raven); 8ηά the Crockern Tor, interesting to
antiquaries, is on 8 lower a little to the south-east. A few of the trees

 

are scatteredg but by far t e greater are packed‚ as it were, amo the ⁶

low blocks of gianite that lie in abu ance on the hill side3 the gnari 8ηά
twisted sterne reclining in the spaces between the rocks, and formed into an
undistinguishable mass with them by 8 thick mat of moeses and lichena, of
which the Anomodon curtipendulum, ὓεαηηέἰῑε very rare capsules in profu-
sion, contributes a large proportion. 1 di not observa stems of any large
size, but they display incontestable marks of great antiquity. The branches
riae a very few feet above the rocks, and
their twigs are very short, yet 1 found on
them 8 tolerably vgorous crop of leaves
and acorns.'' (W. . Meavy's Oak (fig.
