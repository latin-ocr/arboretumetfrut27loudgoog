Ἰ U. a. 4- incisa H. S. See the plate in our last Volume. — This variety
differs from the other varieties‚ in having the leaves somewhat more
deeply serrated, and rather smaller, 8 proaching nearer to those of
U. effusa. There is a tree in the orticultural Society's Garden,
which, in 18:34, was27 ft. high.

Description, ‹5-0. The leaves of the· white American clm, according to
Michaux‚ are 4-in. or 5 in. long, borne on short petioles, alternate, unequal at
the base, omi-acuminate, and doubly denticulated = they are generally smaller
than those of the red elm ( U‘lmus (a.) ffilva? The flowers

hunches at the extremity of the branches. The seeds are '¹
contained in flat, oval, fnnged capmles, notched at the base. f
The trunk is covered with a tender white bark, very deeply
furrowed. In favourable situations, on the banks of rivers, f
the tree reaches a great height, and displays extraordinary β’
magnificeuce of vegetation. ‘⁸ In clearing the primitive

forests‚’' says Michaux, “‘a few specimens of the white elm
are sometimes left standing. Insulated in this manner, it
appears in all its 'esty, towerin to the height of 80 ft. or
100 st„ with a trun 4 st. or 5 . in diameter 3 regularly

(N. Amer. Syl„ iii. p. 85.) In New Hampshire, he adds, ‘⁸ a great number of

young white elms are seen detached in the middle of the pastui-es: they
