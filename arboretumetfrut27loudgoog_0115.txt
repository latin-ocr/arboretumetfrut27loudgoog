writers on the ailkworm appear to prefer needling planta, or p ants raised
from layere or cuttings, to failed ones. In pruning, cutting in, or heading
down, the trees, the great o ject is to preserve the equilibrium of the heads,
ιο that the sap may be equall distributed throu the branches on every
side. On this depende the r uction of a crop o leaves of equal quality on
every part of the tree, which ia alike important both for the first crop, which
