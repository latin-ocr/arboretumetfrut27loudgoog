are covered with 8 viseid matter, which is said to be of use in medicine. P.
alba, P. (a.) canescens, 8ηά their varieties, ere easily distinguishable from all
the other species, even at 8 considerable distance, when their leaves are
ruffled by the wind, from the thick white cottony down which covers their
under sul-face. The tremulous motion of the leaves, which is common,
in 8 greater or less degree, to all the poplsrs, roceeds from the great length
of the petioles, in pro rtion to the size an weight of the leaves to which
they are attached. iny speaks of three kinds-of popler: the black, the
white, 8ηά the poplar of Libya. He mentions that the poplar was cultivated
as 8 prop to the vine (Ptin, lib. xvi. cap.23. and ca . 37.); and that the
trees were lanted in quincunx, in order that they mi t obtain more light
8ηά air. e also says that the wood of the poplar, l' e that os the willow,
and of all the aquatic trees, is particularly suitable for making bucklerS,
from its „lightness3 8ηά because, when struck, the bldw only indents
the soft wood, without piercing or cracking it. The poplar buckler
thus acted like 8 shield of Indian rubber, or any other clastic substance,
and repelled the blow. The ancients applied the leaves of the poplar,
macerated in vinegsr, to parts affected by'the gout3 and they dried the
young shoots with the leaves on during summer, 8ηά laid thein b , to
serve as winter food for cattle. The wood of the o lar is soft, ight,
8ηά generally white, or of a pale yellow. It is but of litt e use in the arts,
except in some departments ‘of cabinet 8ηά toy making, 8ηά for boarded floors;
sor which last purpose it is well ada ted, from its w iteness, 8ηά the facility
with which it is scoured3 and, els0, rom the difficulty with which it eatches
fire, 8ηά the slowness with which it burne. In these respects, it is the very
reverse of deal. Poplar, like other soft woods, is generally considered not
dumble3 but this is onl the case when it is exposed to the externa} atmo-

here, or to water3 an hence the old distich, said to be inscribed on 8 poplar

is, tffss’t, from the rapidity of its growth, it forms 8 screen sor shuttitig out ob-
jects, 8ηά affbrds shelter 8ηά shnde sooner than any other tree. The iemales
of several of the exotic kinds of poplar have never been introduced into
Britain3 and, consequently, little opportunity has been found for raising new
varieties from seeds3 but all the kinds, whether in ⁸ nous or ibreign, are
readily propagated b cuttings or layers, 8ηά some of m bylsuckers. · They
all like a moist soil: ‘culnrly when it is near 8 running stream3 but none
of them thrive in marsffir undried soil, as is commonl supposed. On very
dry ground, the leaves of the-poplar grow yellow, 8ηά f loff much sooner than
when they are planted in 8 more congenial situation; but the timber, in dry
soils, is said to be more compact, fine-grainess 8ηά durable. P. alba 8ηά ⁷
