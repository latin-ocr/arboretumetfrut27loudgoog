· inch in diameter, smooth on the surface next to the leaf, but hirsute and red
on the outside: they are nearly flat, the thickest portion being the centre,
where the point of attachment to the leaf is placed on the inside. This stalk,
or funicular attachment, as it may be called, is very short, so that the excres-
cence nearly lies flat· upon the leaf. AESee {ugk 1652.α.) The Rev. W. T. Bree

wood cannot find that their isto has been satisfactorily traced by any writer
upon the economy of insecta. ees von Esenbeck observes of these‘oak
spangles, “ Mirum tamen, gallaa esse, quas etiamsi frequentissimas omnium,
nemo hu ue incola sua faetas invenerit, vel quomodo orientia· cognoverit.”
(H . onogia, ii. p. 266.) Reaumur has described and them
( bna, tom. iii. mem. 12. pl. 42. f. 8. 10.) under the names o galles en
champignon, from their resemblance to a flat mushroom. He was never,
however,able to discover any appearance of an interna! cavity ς but he adds, “ 11
faut pourtant qu’il y en ait dans le milieu de quelques unes, car M. Malp’ ‘

-assure l’avoir observo? He, however, discovered that the space between e
under side of the excrescence and the leaf was the residence of a small worm,
of an oblong form and yellowish arnber colour, with two small points on the
sront os the head. Under some of these ls one or two only were found,
but as many as a dozen under others. abricius, without alludia to these
