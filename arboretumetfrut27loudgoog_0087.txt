Mountaina, from Pennsylvama to

carolina ς producing ita ellowiab

brown flowers in May and une. It

was introduced in 1⁷63, and ia sre-

quent in gardent, where it forma a

tall twiuiug ahrub, flowering abun·

dantly. ln favourable situations it

reaches to a considerable height: a

The appearance of the ificent

leaves of thia species is ' ing. In

its native country, it climbe and

twinee to the summita os the very

highest trees ς flowering early in sum·

mer, and ripening ita aeeds in autumn,

though but aparingly. Thia species

is remarkable for the form of ita -,-,

florifer, which is bent like a tiphon5 for the trifid border of ita corolla; for
the very large bractea placed on the middle of the peduncle3 and sor the
disposition of the seedn, and the aril common to all the seeda of each cell.
The roots are woody, and have the amell of eam bor. The stema‚branchea‚

and twigs are also strongly acented, aa are the wera. In British gardens,
this speciea, to grove freely‚ require· a deep free soil, dry rather than moin,
and a warm situation. It ia propagated by division of the root, by auckers,
or by weda, which are sometime· received from North America. Price
