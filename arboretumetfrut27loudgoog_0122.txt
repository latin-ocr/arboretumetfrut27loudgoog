bnt ali htly aeid. It did not appear half ri e when we received itg and it
(ἴε-σιμῇ without coming to maturitssr We have since, at different times, re-
ceived two other fruita, also from . Menae ς but perceived no difference
between them and the one figured above. The seeds in the fruit last re·
eeived appearing full, we distributed them ; and young lanta have been raised
stom them by M. Vilmorin of Paris ς Mr. Gordon o the London Horticul-
tural Society's arboretum3 Mr. Campbell of the Botanic Gai-den, Manchee-
ter3 and others. Mr. R. Buist, in the American Gardener’s Magam'uoe, vol. ii.
p. 77„ states that there are four trees in Mrs. M‘Mahon’s Numen-y, Phila·
delphia, which were among the first introduced into that part of America. Tbey
are planted two and two, each pair being about 400 ft. a . [n 1831, it was dis·
covered that one of these trees produced larger fruit t an the others, and that
this fruit contained perfect aeeda. Two of the other trees roduced snialler fivuit,
but the seeds they contained were abortive; while one o the trees was entirely
barren. The next year, it wan discovered that the barren tree was the male plant3
and that the tree which produced perfect seeds was the fertile plant, which
stood by its side. The wood is of a ' ht yellow colour, uncommonly fine-

the Maclura tinctoria, or fustick tree < a atove plant, a native of the Weat In·

some to employ it as a hedge plant, and by others aa a stock to the mulberryg
and it has been suggested that it might rove a valuable substitute for, or
auxiliary to, the M. a. multicaulia, as foo for the silkworm. A memorial to
the latter effect, it is said, has lately been presented to the French Institute.
See Amer. Gara. Mag„ vol. i. p. 400.) Μ. Bonafous‚ visiting the Botanic
den at Montpelier, in 1835, and observing the luxuriance with which the
maclura grew there, had a number of the leaves gathered, and tried to seed
flilkworms with them, in the same way as is done with those of the mulberry.
He gave the leaves of the mac-lura to 18 silkworms‚ as their only food, and
they produced ver beautiful cocoonsg but it is not stated how these cocoona
turned out when ey were reeled. A·second expet-inient was made in 1836,
hy M. Raffeneau De Lile, director of the Montpelier Garden, by giving 50
silkworms the leaves of the maclura only during the latter part of their ex-
istence. The worma were not fed on the maclura till the 19th of May, when
they cast their second skins. These worma never seemed to eat the leave·
greedily3 but they increased in size as much as those that were fed on the
