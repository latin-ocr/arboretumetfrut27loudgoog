1453 ARBORETUM Am) rammawm. mm· ιη.

Anderson, F.L.S.‚ had at that timo a collection at West Ham, in Essex,
which he was studying for the same purpose3 as had Edward Forster, Esq„
at Walthamstow, and which has since been removed to Woodsord, in Essex ς
and W. Borrer, Esq., at Henfield, in Sussex. At Lewes, in the same county,
Mr. Woollgar had extensive willow grounds, studied the s ecies very assidu·
ousl „and communicated several facts to Sir J. E. Sinit . Subsequently,
a c lection was made by His Gracc the Duke of Bedford at Woburn, which
appears to have been the most extensive till then made in England3 and the
next greatest number of sorts is in the arboretum of Meser. Loddiges, at
Hackney. In all these salictums, we are informed by those who have ex-
amined them, the planta were placed too closely t ther to attain their
characteristic form and size. At Woburn, the p ants were, till 1836,
crowded together in a very limited space, which necessarily prevented
their habits from being properly studie 3 but they have since been trans·
planted, and allowed more room; though they are not, even now, as it
appears to us, in a situation either sufficiently large, or adequately ex-
posed to the influente of the sun and the air. A few species of wdlows have
attained the size of trees in the Horticultural Society's Garden3 but, as
far as we are aware, there is no extensive collection of full-grown willows any
where either in Britain or ou the Continent. Most of the kinds in the
Woburn salictum are in the arboretum at Flitwick House, at Goldworth,
and at Messrs. Loddiges's, Hackney; and we believe, also, that there are
excellent collections in the principal botanic garrienti, more especially in
that of Edinburgh. The Duke of Bedford, indeed, has liberally contributed
cuttings from his collection at Woburn to all who have ap lied for them3
so that, if willows are not in future extensively cultivat , and properly
studied, it will not be for want os plnum, but from the cultivators not allowing
them sufficient room to attain their natural size and habits. On the Continent,
the best collections are in Germany, and princi lly, we believe, at Erlangen,
under the direction of Koch. Dr. Hostis sai to have cultivated upwards
of 300 sorts in the botanic gar-den under his care at Vienna; and there are
good collections at Gottingen, Bremen, and Berlin. Ι
In an economical point of view, scarcely anything was added to our know-
ledge of the culture and uses of the willow since the time of the Romanu
till the slight notices of the uses of willows given by Ray, and afterwards by
Evelyn. The first systematic essay on the subject appears to‘ have been
written by Dr. Walker, about the latter end of the last century, though not
published till 1812. It is entitled salicetum ,- or, the Botam'cal Histmy and
cultivation of Willows ,- and it is contained in his volume of Essays, p. 40:3—
469. Here 22 species are described, and an account is given of their uses
and mode of cultivation. All these s ecies, and various othei-S, which are
romiscd to be, described in a future volume, were cultivated hythe author in

wi ows for basket-making and hoops were principally imported from
Holland and France, till towards the commencement of the present century3
when our exclusion from the Continent, in consequence of the continued war,
led to the formation of plantations at home. The Society of Arts, directing
their attention to the subject, have, at various times, offered premiums for the
cultivation of willows; and in their Trou-raeticus for 1801, 1804, and 1805, as
well as iu revious and subsequent voluineS, will be found accounts of plant-
ations m e for which premiums were awarded. In En land, the principa!
of these lantations were made by Arthur Borron of errington, in Lan-
cashire3 r. Wade of Suffolk3 and Mr. Phillips and Mr. Bull of Ely: and,
in Scotland, by Mr. Shirreff, at Captainhead, near Haddington.
