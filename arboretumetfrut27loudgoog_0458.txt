from the whiteness of its bark, which renders it more conspicuous in winter
than in summer. lts stem, as Gilpin observes, ‘⁴ is generally marked with
brown, yellow, and silvery touches, which are peculiarly picturesque, as they
are characteristic ob‘ects of imitation for the pencil, and as they contrast
agreeably with the ark green hue of the foliage. But only the stem and
lar branches have this varied colouring. The s ray is osa deep brown, which

As the birch grows old, its bark becomes rough and furrowed: it loses all its
varied tints, and assumes a uniform ferruginous hue.” (Foreet Scenery, vol. i.

y birch, from “ its spray bein slender, and longer than that of the common
sort, forms an elegant, pensile foliage, like that of tlte weeping willow3 and,
like it, is put in motion by the least breath of air. When agitated, it is well

Thes birch, however, esseginnggan extremely common tree in various districts,
and never being suffered t'o ow in any quantity, in its native countries, in
those soils and situations wlfere other trees will thrive, there are certain asso-
ciations connected with it which are unfavourable to its use in gardenesque
scenery. Nevertheless, it must be allowed that these associatione can only
be experienced by those who have seen the tree in its native habitata. Nativcs
of Scotland, North Wales, Sweden, Russia, and Germany would regard the

‚birch as indicating poor, sandy, boggy, or rocky soil; and would not place
it on a lawn3 from the same feelings that would prevent a London lanter
from placing there· the alder, or any of the common willows. In t e gar-
denesqne style, therefore, or in that species of pictures ue which is an
. imitation of nature, and not an identification of her scenery, t e birch,in most

s of Europe, would require to be planted in situations where it would not
monspicuoun and never where it would form a leading feature in any
general view. The same principle plies in the case of every indigenous tree3
and with a force proportionem-to {lie commonness of that tree in the country
where the gardenesque plantation is to be made. A residence planted in a
style truly gakrdenesque ought, as we have osten observed, to have no indigenous
trees in it w atever.

style, and which are intended to form scenes which will be considered

Where the common birch is so favour-ite a tree as to make it desired in
considerable numbers, the only mode of introducing it into artificial scenery
in countries where it abounds, is by planting it in avenues, or in geometrical
lines ς or by having a scene ex ressly devoted to a fac-simile imitation of nature.
