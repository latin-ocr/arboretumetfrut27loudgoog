Desa-iption, ἅς. This
oak, according to the
younger Michaux, ie the
ostiest oak in Amet-ica,
being from oost. to 100
st. high, with a trunk
stom 4st. to5st. in dia-
meter. The trunk ie
straight, and is covered
with a deepl furrowed
berk of mid ing thick-
ness, but always bleck,
or of a very deep brown
colour3 whence, pro-
hebly, the tree derives
its common name in
America3 viz. the blank
oak. The dark hue of
the berk easily distin-d
guishes this tree from Q.
rubra, Q. coccinea, and
Q. ambigua, in the
northern provincee; but,
in the southern ones,
Q. falchta having berk of the same colour, Q. tinctoria can only be dis-
tinguished'by its buda, which are longer, more acuminate, and more scaly,
than those of the former species. The inner berk of Q. tinctoris, if chewed‚
is very bitter‚ anda-gives ά yellow tin to the saliva, which is not the case with
the berk of Q· f ohta. The woo ie reddieh, come-grained, and potone,
like thet of all the red oaks. The leaves are large, deeply inciniated, an
resemble those of Q. coccinea, but the have fewer lobes, never exceeding
four or five3 while the leaves of the ol trees of Q. coccinea have from five
to seven: they are also lens openly and rou-dl sinuated, less ehining, of ι
duller green, and, during a pert of the summer, ave their eurfecee roufihened ‘
with small lande, which are visible to the eye and s-sible to the touc ς and
which are giso found on the young ehoots. In autumn, the leaves of young

trees turn to a dull red; but those on old trees become yellow, or of a yel-
