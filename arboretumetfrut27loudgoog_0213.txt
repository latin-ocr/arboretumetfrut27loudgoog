Huyne Denda, as cited in Koch Coma. It seems that Koch (emm.) and
Lindley (synope. Brit. Fe.) view the kinds of the group Purpureae which
bave only 1 stamen to a flower, as having that stamen constituted of 2 com-
bined. Resides the kinds of that group treated ofin our work, exclusively of
S. rubra, which may be examined as to the testing of this view, S. oppositi-
felia of Hon’e Sal. Ausim, i. t. 38.; S. austriaca ibid„ i. t. 64.; S. montana

The Sea-es. Botanists seem to differ in opinion,as to the influence which
the sex has upon the character, or appearance, of the lanta. Dr. Walker
says that ‘⁸ the male and female, of e sanie species, o en differ remarkably
from each other in their foliage ;” and he instances the S. alba L„ in the female
of which, be says, “the leaves are much larger‚ greencr, and not so white, sil-
very, and pubescent, as those of the male. This makes the difference in their
aspect so great, he says, that, when standing together, they might, at first view,
be presumed to be different species. In general,” he adds, “ the female os most
planta is of more vigorous growth, of larger siae, and less brittle, than the
male3 and,'' therefore, “the female ought always to be preferred when the

is of a very different opinioqn from Dr. ⁸ alker,as{ei·iing that between-a male
and a female plant of the same species “ there is not the slightest possible dif-
ference in the character or appearance of the two individuals, in any other
respect” than in their flowers. (Eng. Flora, vol. iv. . 163.) Most other
botanists seem to incline more to the opinion of Dr. walker, than to that of
Sir J. E. Smith (see Deffoataines's Histoire, δια, vol. ii. p. 460 3 N. Du
Ham„ vol. iii. . 104„ διο.) ; and it is only necessary to turn over the figures
of the splendid³ work of Host, in which engravings, a foot or two in length,
aregiven of the male and female of every species, to be convinced that the view ·
taken by Dr. ‘Walker is correct. The importance, then, of lgnowing to what

,γὼ-ἰώ. The roduction of hybrids in this genus was observed by Sco·
poli in 1760, and since been confirmed or admitted b most other bota-
nists. “ The great number of h brids in this genus,” Kimh observes, “no
one can deny.'' (p. 9.) · Sir J. li. Staium, however, formed quite a different
opinion. During the thirty years that he studied the willows in ΜΓ. Crowe’s
garden, along with that botanist, “ seedlings innumerable,” he says, “springing
up all over the ground, were never destroyed till their species were de-
termined, and the immutability of each verilied by our joint inspection. This
was the more material, to set aside the gratuitous suppositione of the mixture
os species, or the production of new or hybrid ones, of which, no more than
of any change in established species, 1 have never met with an instance.
Sti-ange alterations in the shapes and sizes of leaves, and their stipules, have,
indeed, been seen on young radical shoots‚ from a trce or bush that has been
felled ς but not more than usually happens in po lars, limes, elms, and
others? (Eng. F1.,iv. p. 165.) lt is much to be wislied that some cultivator
of willows would endeavour to originate, scientifically, some hybrida between
species with opposite characters of foliage, which would set this question
a Grztgraphy. The willows are chiefly natives of the colder parts of the
