about equal in length to the hmb. Branches angular.

shrub‚ with long slender shoots, and rone to throw
u innumerable suckers3 a native o the south of
urope, where it grows to the height of from lo ft.
to 12 st.; flowering from May till August. It was
introduced in 1730, andis common in Bntish enas
where it ἐ valuable for coveri naked w ls, as ιι
ws with extreme rapidity, an flowers and fruita
ffel„ in almost any soil or situation. Established
platus, in good soil, will make shoots 10 st. or 12 st.
m length iu one aeason3 and the plant, when trained
against a house or high wall, will reach the height of
30 ιι. or 4011„ as may be seen in some courts m
Paris. Trained to a strong iron rod, to the height
of 20 st. or 30 st„ and then allowed to s read over an
umbrella head, it would make a splendi bower. Its
shoots would hang down to the ground, and form a
complete screeu on every side, ornamented from top
to bottom with ripe funt, which is large, and b ⁹ ht
scarlet or yellow; with unripe fruit, which is o a
lurid urple3 or with blossoms, which are· purple
and w ite. Some idea of the quantity of ripe and
unripe fruit, and of blossoms‚ which may be found on
a shoot at one time, may be formed from fig. 1108„
which is only a portion of a shoot, the upper poet of
which (not exhibited in the figure) contained two or
three dozen of fruit, all ripe at once. If it were re·
uired to open the sides os a bower covered with
hevam? mm mewa

Varietz'ee. There is a variety with yellow fruit, and
another with the fruit roundish3 and, in our opinion,
L. barbarum, chinense, ruthenicum, Shawi, and Tre-
wffluwu, all which we have seen in Lodtligea’s arbo-
retum; and, probably, other sorts which we have not

tseen, are nothing more than variations of the same
orm.
