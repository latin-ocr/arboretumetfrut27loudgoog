in the Milford Armi-etum, were equally beautiful before they were severely
cut in, to give more room to the surrounding plants.

(N. Amer. Syl„ i. . 86.) According ⁷
to the youn r chaux, this oak is confined to the lower part of the
Carolinas an Georgia. It grows in soils too meagre tofustam any other
vegetation, where the light movable saud is wholly destitute of vegetsblp
mould. It is the only species multiplied in the pme ban-reuss and f1'0m ὼ·
circumstance, and its scrubby habit of growth, ,ι
it has probabi obtained the name of the barren ἢ. *a

in such numbers on this oak, that they sometimes break down the branches,
and leave their dung some inches thick under the trees. The elder Mi2
chaux 88 s that Catesby has confounded this tree with Q. τῶι-85 which
is probabi} the case, as his deseri tion accords much better with that s i
than this tree. The wood of Q. atesboe*i is considered excellent 88 fite ς azzi
it bears a higher price than that of azy ot2her oak in America for that purpose,
