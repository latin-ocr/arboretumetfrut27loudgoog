ent; for, while the fruit of the common walnut begins to drop in the first or
second week in September, that of the black walnut does not fall till the end
of the same mouth, and that of the grey waluut, not till the beginning of
October. (Mart. Mill.) To this necnon may be added Pterocarya, a genua
reeently separated from Juglana.

has the fruit double the aize of that of the species, being sometimes
nearly aa large aa a turkey’a egg ς but, in drying, the kei-nel ohrinka
to one half its aize 3 and, hence, the fruit of this variety is not good
sor keeping, but ought to be eaten directly aster being gethered.
The leaves are large, and the tree has a magnificent appearance3

most elicate fruit of all the walnuts: it keeps longer, an produces
more oil ; but it ie not ao good a bearer aa the other sorta. M. Trat-
tinik,aGerman botanist, stateS, in the Nouveau Du Hamel, that he
has seen a tree of the Juglana r* ⁸ which only produced female
cathina, and never male one83 an that it bore every year a great
quantity of fruit with a tendet shell. It ia known that the abella
of walnuta are much more tender in some years than in other83 and,
aleo, that the shells osten vary in their degrees of hardnesa on the
same tree, in the earne γεω-ς and, very likely, this may depend on
