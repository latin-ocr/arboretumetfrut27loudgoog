abeles at once sent over into England from FlanderS, and trans lanted into
many counties; 8ηά Mortimer,writing in the beginning of the eig teenth cen·
tury, says that the best sorts of abele trees come from Holland and Flanders.
Evel yn mentions the σεε as being raised in abundance from cuttings‚truncheons,
and suckers3 addin , that “there is a finer sort of white poplar, which the Dutch
call abee13 and weq'lave of late much of it transported out of Holland.” The
Dutch, he adds, “look upon a plantation of these trees as an ·ample portion
for a daughter.” (Hunter s Evelyn, vol. i. . 209.)

Πυέστῃ. The abele was known to the mans, as we have already noticed
when {Wing the history of thel-genus. As a mad-side σεε, it has been much
plante , in modern times, in olland, Flanders, and in some parts of France
and Germany. In the forests of France, it is so abundant, in some places, as
to form the prevailing σεε over extensive tracts of country ; and it furnishes·
fuel for the adjoining towns3 more especially for bakers' ovens‚ those of Paris
being almost entirely heated with the wood of this tree, which is there ‘called
le bois blapc. In Britain, the white poplar has been propagated in nurseries
since the time of Miller-3 but it does not appear to have been ever very exten·
sively ἐξωθεῖ ἰ8 massas, though there are trees of it to be found here and
there 0 hout the country. In Scotland, it was 8 po ular σεε about the
beginning o the present century3 more es ' y, as ang informs us, for
moist situations, which it was not thoug t advisable to drain. In such
situations, however, thou h it will grew, it never attains al size.

cracks considerably in drying, losing one quarter of its bulk. ‘l'he wood of
P. (a.) canescens is said to be much harder and more durable than that of P.
alba3 in the same manner as the wood·of the Tilia europae¹a parvisolia is finer-
grained and harder than that of Τ. ε. grandifdlia. The wood is the whitest of
any of the species; and it is used, in France and Germany, for 8 variety of
minor purposes, particularly when lightness, either osweight or colour, is thought
‚desirable ς or where an artificial colour is to be given by staining. It is excellent
for forming packing-cases, because nails may be driven into it without its split·

which prevents it mulgh increaysin the expense oflizarreizsgz’. The princtpal use,
of the wood of the white poplar in ritain is for flooring-boards 3 but sor this pur-
pose it r uires to be seasoned for two or three years before using. According
to Mitche ‚ when felled at the point of maturity (see description above), abele
wood is good for any kind of building purposes, especially on farma, where it
is very suitable for the large folding oors for bai-ns, as it is light, and never
yarps. It is also used as a substitute for the wood of the lime σεε by musical

mstrument makers,„and by carvers in wood. In Scotland, it is sometimes ·

used in mill-work, and by the cabinet-maker and tumen and it is frequently
used by the cooper, for making wooden dishes and casks. The leaves are
eaten by cattle in Sweden, and are considered wholesome. As an ornamental
σεε, it ts chiefl to be recommended in scenery on a large scale3 since its great
. h ' ht and amp e head overpower most artificial objects, such as buildm 3
an most exone trees, from the comparative slowness of their growth. he
fittest trees to plant alon with the white poplar are other rapid rowing
poplars and willows; and t ε fittest situations are the margins of br rivers,
or that of a large lake. In many situations in England, s imens of this σεε
exist, which, though fine in themselves, in'ure, by their ' pro rtionate size,

to which the σεε can be applied in ritain, next to that of planting it by rivers
and lakes, is for planting it in avenues, or by road sides: for the former, it is
recommended on account of the rapidity of lts growth3 8ηά for the latter, be-

oeuse its trunk is generally clear of branc-hes to a considerable height, and,
