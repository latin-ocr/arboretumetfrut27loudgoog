Sect. Char. Leaves deeply lobed, sinuated, multifid, 8ηά ωυοτου8ῐεά., Bark
dark, and not scaliug ost. Fructifieation biennial. Nut ovate,·with a per-
sistent st le. Cup imbricate, large in proportion to the nut. Trees, varying
from 80 . or 90 ft. to 15 ft. or 20 ft. m he' ις remarkable for the bright
red, deep scarlet, or dark purple, of their fo ” e, when it dies off in autumn.
Perhaps most of the kinds in this section mig t be reduced to two or three
speciee3 but, as the come up tolerably true from seed, we have considered
it more convenient or the cultivator to treat them as distinct. The har-
dieet and most rapid owing, and at the same time the most elegant and
ornamental, tree of thre section is Q. palustria, which, with its spreading
droo ing branches, and its straight erect trunk 8ηά spiry top, is, indepen-
dent y of its lively scarlet, orange, and red colours in spring 8ηά autumn, in-
our opinion, the most graceful of all oalm, either European or American.

Spec. Char„ 6¹⁶. Leaves smooth, oblong, sinuated, on long stalks; lobes acute
sharply toothed, bristle-pointed. Calyx· of the fruit flat underneath.
Nut orate. (mad.) A tree Βοὴ. or 90 ft. m height. Introduced m 1739.

Varie-ties. Aiton, in the Hortus Kewensis, 2d ed„ mentions two varieties: Q.
rubra latifolia, the champion oak, which is the Q. rubra of Linnaeus3 and Q.
rubra montana, the mountain red oak.

Des tion, ᾇε. The red oak is, in America, a tall widely spreading tree,
freque‘n't'fy more than 80 ft. high, and with a trunk 3st. or 4 ft. in diameter.
The bark is com arativelysmooth, osa dark colour, very thick3 and, though in
old trees it crac s, et it never scales off as in the sections A'lbae and Prinus.
The wood is reddis and coarse-grained3 and its pores are osten so large as
to admit the entrance of a hair. The leaves, when they first come out in spring, μ
are of a fine sulphur colour3 when fully expanded, they are smooth 8ηά
shining on both sides, large, deeply laciniated, and sometimes slightly rounded
at the base, especially on old trees; and, before they fall, they turn of a
deep purplish red. According to the younger Michaux, the leaves on old

 

trees osten nearly resemble those of Q. falcata. The leaves of Q. falcata
are, however, always downy beneatggr wthile those os Q. rubra are smooth.
