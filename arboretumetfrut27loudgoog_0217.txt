'I'hames and the Cam are the most celebrated. In both these rivers, and in
some others, small islanda are frequently planted entirely with willows‚ and
are called osier holts. There are many such islands in the Thimea, between
London 8ηά Reading. The most extensive willow plantatione in fields are
in the fenny districts of Cambridge-abire and Huntingdonshire ; and, perh a,
the largest plantation in England is that of Mr. Adnam, near Reading. '‘lllie
prineipal niarket for basket willows is London ς but they are in demand, more

A crop of wi ows was considered so valuable in the time of Cute, that ho

garden. ln modern times, ‘⁴ the many important uses,” Sir . J. Hooker
observes, ‘⁴ rendered to man by the different species of willow and osier, serve to
rank them among the first in our list of economical plants.’' In a state of nature,
the willow ἴοι-11181188 food by its leaves to the larvae of moths, gnate, and
certain other insects3 and, by its flowers‚ to the honey-bee. lts wood, als0, is
preferred to most others by the beaver. The leaves and young shoots are
wholesome and nourishing to cattle3 and in some northern countries they are
collected green, and then dried and stacked for that purpose. In France,
those of S. caprea, whether in a green or dried state, are considered the very
best food sor cows and goats; and horsea, in some places, are sed entirely on
them, from the end of August till November. Horses so fed, it is stated, will
travel 20 leagues a day without being fatigued. (Bere.) In the north of Sweden
and Norway, and in Lapland, the inner bark is kiln-dried and ground for
the purpose of mixing with oatmeal in years of scarcity. In a rude state of
civilisation, the twigs of the willow were used in constructing houses, house-
hold utensile, panniers, the harness of horsea 8ηά cattle, and for various pur-
poaes connected with boats and fishing. The twigs are still very generally

the trunks os young trees is used nernlly, throughout the north of Europe,
for the same purposes as that of t e lime tree (See p. 368.); and in Tartary,
it is said, it is maeerated‚ and the fibre, when separated, spun into threads,
from which eloth is woven.

The bark of the willow‚ and also the leaves, are astringent ς and the berk of
mostsorts maybe em loyed in tannin . That of S. caprea is used both for tanniu
and dyeing black, in &wedem the nort of Scotland, and Switzerland. (Walker.
A substance called salicine bas been extracted from the bark of S. Russelln'ima,
S. Helix, and some other kinds os willow, which Professor Burnet states to

Chimie,tom. x iii. p. 440„ as quoted in Brande's Journal for 1831.) Salicine is
in the form of very fine nacreous whitish crystals, persectly soluble in water
or alcohol. It is ver bitter‚ and partakes something of the colour of willow
burk. The process or obtaining it is rather long3 and it requires about 311»
