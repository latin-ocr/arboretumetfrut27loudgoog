Description‚ dv. A shrub, or low tree, rarely exceeding 25 st. in height, but
generally forming a bush of only lost. or left. high, with round glabrous
brancheS, covered with a brownish bark. The petiole of the leaf is very short ς
the disk is unequally dentated, somewhat beart-shaped‚ and glabrous; lt ia of a
deep green above, and paler beneath, and is of a thicker texture than that of
Celtis australis, The struit, which is solitary, and borne on a long peduncle, is
oval, greenish at first, then becomin yellowish, and aflei-warda nearly black.
From the specimens in the London orticultural Society’s (iarden, the fruit
does not appear to ripen so soon as that of C. occidentalia aa, in October, 1836.
the fruit of C. Tournefortii was quite firm and green, while that of C. occi-
dentalis was shriveled, blackish, and extremely sweet. C. Toni-nefor& ia a
native of the Levant3 from which country Tournefort brought the seeds to
the Jardin des Flentes, in Paria, about 1717, whence planta have been dis-
tributed all over Europe. It was introduced into England in 1739. lt is
rather more tendet than 0. australis and 0. occidentalis. The aeeds should
be sown in autumn, aa soon as they are ripe; aa, if not sown till spring, they
generally remain a year or more in the ground. They prefera moist soil, and a
sheltered situation. This species is readily known from all othere, in winter,
by its forming a compact upright-branched bush, or low tree3 and, in summer,
b the deep green and dense mass of its ' ‘d-looking foliage. There are
p anta of it from δὴ. to 8 st. high, in the ondon Horticultural Society's
Gar-den, and at Maesta. Loddiges’a.
