stands singly in a very conspicuous situation, on rising ground, and attracta
the notice of travellers. At Melbury Park, there is an old oak, called Billy

eccentricity of Daniel Day, commonly called ‘ Good Da ‚' who, about 1720,
was wont to invite his friends to dine with him, the first Fri y in J uly, on beans
and bacon, under this venerable tree. From this circumstance becoming known,
the public were attracted to the spot3 and about 1725 the fair above mentioned
was established, 8ηά was held for many years on the ad of July in each year.
Mr. Day never failed to provide annually several sacks of baana, which he
distributed, with a propornonate quantity of bacon, from the hollowed trunk
of the oak, to the crowds assembled. The project of its patron tended
greatl , however, to in'ure his favourite tree; 8ηά the orgies annually cele·
brat to the honour o the Fairlo Oak, yearly curtailed it of its fair pro-
portions. Some years ago, Mr. orsyth's composition was applied to the
decaved branchos of this tree, to preserve it from future injury; ,probably by
the Hainault Archery Society, who held their meetings near· it. (Lycum.)
At this period, a board was affixed to one of the limbs of this tree, with this
inscription :- “ All good foresters are requested not to hurt this old tree, a
plaster havin been latel ap lied to his wounds.’' (See Gent. Mag. for
1793, p. 792. Mr. Day had gis coffin made of one of the limbs of this tree, ·
which was torn off in a storm; and, dying in 1767, at the age of 84,
he was buried in it in Barking churchyard. The persons assembled at the
fair frequently mutilated the tree; and it was severely injured b some
gipsieS, who made its trunk their place of shelter. But the most fa injury
it received was in 1805, from a arty of about sisty cricketers, who had spent
the day under its shade, and w o carelessly lest a fire burning too near its
trunk. The tree was discovered to be on fire about ' ht in the evening, two
hours aster the cricketers had lest the spot3 and, thoria a number of persons,
with buckets and pails of water, endeavoured to ext' 'sh the flames, the
tree continued burning till morning. (Geni. Mag„ une, 1805, p. 574.)
‘⁶ The high winds of February, 1820? Professor Burnet informs us, ‘⁸ stretched
this forest patriarch on the ground, aster having endured the storms of per·
haps 1000 winters. Its remams were purchased by a builder3 and from a
portion thereos the ulpit and reading-desit in the new church, St. Pancras,
were constructed: t ey are beautiful specimens of British oak, and will long
preserve the recollection of this memorable tree.'’ (Amce-n. Quen, fol. 15.)
