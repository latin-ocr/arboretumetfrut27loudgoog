and in other towns sittiated farther north,for
inlaying. The tree affords excellent fuel.
The berk, like that of the Euro species,
is, in Canada and the district o Maine, em-
ployed for many urposes. It is laced in
large pieces immeAEstely under the 'ngles of
the roos, to prevent the water stom etrating
through it. Baskets, boxes, anffonfolios
are made of it, which are sometimes em·
broidered with silk of different colours. Di-
vided into very thin sheets‚ it for-ms a sub·
stitute for paper3 and, placed between the

canoes. To rocure 'proper pieces, the largest and smoothest trunks are
selected. In t e spring, two circular incisione are made several feet spart, and
two longitudinal ones on the opposite sides of the tree3 after which, by intro-
ducing a wooden wedge‚ the‘ bark is easily detached. The plates are usually
10 st. or 12 st. long, and 2 st. 9 in. broad. To form the eanoe, they are stitched
together with the fibrous roots of the white spruce, about the size of a quill,
which are deprived of their bark, split‚ and rendered supple by steeping in
water. The seams are coated with resin of the Balm of G1lead fir. Great use
is made of these canoes by the aavages, and by the French Canadians, in their
long journeys into the interior of the conata: they are very light, and are
essuy transported on the shoulders from onel e to another. A canoe calcu-
lated for four persons, with their only weighs from 40 lb. to 50 lb.; and

months of June, Jul , and August, they are found particularly comfortsble.
It has been proposed⁷ to introduce this burk into England‚ and use it for pro· ν
tecting planta during the winter sesson, and for various other garde- purposes.
(See θανά. sung„ vol. xi. . 407.) The tree was introduced into Europe,
and cultivated by Archibalg Duke of Argyle, in 1750. It flounshes, Mlchaux
says, in the vicinity of Paris, and is known there in the nurseries under the
name of B. nigra3 we suppose, because the bark of very young trees is ge·
nerally black, and the leaves of a very dark green. In the London nursenes,
it is not very common; but there e planta of it in the arboretum at Messre.
Lodd· ἐς and, in 1834, in the Horticultural Society’s Garden, there were
sev trees upwards of 30 ft. hi h, after being 10 years planted. B. papyrhcea
requires rather a better soil than t e common buch, and it is best propagated by
seeds, which are annually received from New York. The plant usually known
by the name of B. pap rhcea, in the London nurseries, is the B. rubra of
Michaux, jun„ the B. ulosa of Michaux, sen„ and our B. nigra, No. 9.
This mistake has arisen from the bark of B. nigra, even in trees not above
1 in. in diameter, seperating stom the trunk, and rolling up in very thin
paper-like laminae. -
