flavour, an agreeable agili, and snowy whiteness; particularly in the oung

is consumed in the south of France‚ particularly at Bordeaux and ³Bayonne,
where it is frequentl called champignon Polonm’s, the Polish mushroom

Hungary, and other parts of central Europe, and in Russia. ‘⁶ The best ceps

resembles in taste the common mushroom, and is quite as delicate; and it
might be used to much advantage, as it abounds in seasons when a munh·
room is scarcely to be found. Like that, it can be cultivated, but by a
much more simple process3 as it is merely necessary to moisten the ground
under oak trees, with water in which a quantity has been allowed to ferment.
