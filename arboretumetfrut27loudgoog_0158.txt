It is only wi in the present century that this tree has been much planted
in England, though in Sootland and Ireland its timber has long been conai-
dered as next in valne to that of the oak 3 aud it hae, accordingly, been exten-
aively introduced into artificial plantatione. lt is very remarkable that thia
species seems to be altogether unknown in France and Germany3 neither
being mentioned in the NouveaaDuHamel,the Nouveau Com-s d'Agn'cultwe, the
Dictionnmssre dee Eam· et For-ets, the Flore Frmafaise, nor even in Willdenow’a

American catalogues, it ap to have been introduced into that country.

botarusts. Among the trees of France U'lmus montana Baub- ia included,
but thia, Mirbel, in his Nouveau Du Hamel, makes synonymoua with the Dutch
elm (U. major), and with U. effusa Willd. Sir J. E. Smith, however, con-

various uses in ancient times. It was not onl made into bowa, but its bark,
which is so tough that it will strip or peel off om the wood from one end of
a bough to the other without breaking, was made into ropea. The wood was
not considered so good for naves aa the wood of the common elm,whieh theu, aa
now, was esteemed superior in tou neas and strength, though the wood of the
wych elm cleaved better. In Scot and, where the tree abounda, both naturally
and in artificia! plantatione, it weighs lesa than the wood of the English elm,
and is more coarae—grained. Nevertheleaa, Sang observes, “it ia always prized
next to the wood of the oak.” “It is used,’' he adda, “ by the ship-builder,

laced appearance, which renders it fit for beautiful cabinet-work. A writer in
the Gardener's Magazine (ΜΓ. Ashworth of Prestwich, near Manchoeter,)
states the timber of the Scotch elm to be nearly equal in value to that of
the aah. “ lt is good,'' he sayS, “ for the naves, polea, and shafts of giga and
