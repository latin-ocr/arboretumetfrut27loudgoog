used for that purpose by the Romans. The Britons, indeed, appear to
have possessed a species of navy almost from the earliest period of their
existence as a nation. The ancient name of Britain, according to the
Welch bards, was Olas Merddin, “ the sea-defended n spot ;” 8ηά we read,
that, before the invasion .of Britain by Julius Caesar 52 8. 8.), 8 naval engage-
ment took place between the Romans 8ηά -the Veneti, aided by the Britons,
or Cymry, in which the vessels of the latter are said to have been so firmly
constructed, that the beaks os the Roman ships could with difficulty makean
impression on them. These vessels were built of osken planks, their ⁹ s
were made of skins, and their anchorswere attached to iron chains, or 888188.
The Saxona, who settled in Britain about the middle of the fisth century, were
famed for their pii-acies at sea, and seem to have kept up a formidable marine.
Their vessels, we are told by Aneurin, a Welch hard, ‘⁴ were single-masted,
carrying one square sail. They had curved bottoms, and their prows and poops
were adorned with ·the heads 8ηά tails of monsters.’' (See Saturday Mugazine,
vol. iv. p. 73.) King Alfred, who ascended the throne in 872, had nume-
rous vessels, some of which carried sixty oars; 8ηά his enemies the Danes
were also celebrated for their ships. The E lish vessels, at this period, are
known to have been of oak3 and that thenfhnish 0888 were built of the
same timber is extremely probable. · Professor Burnet, writing on this sub-

two miles from the spot where formerly stood the Roman city of Anderida.
The timber of which this vessel was constructed is oak, perfecti y sound, 8ηά
nearly as hard as iron; and some persons believe it to be one of the ficet
abandoned by the Danes aster their defeat in the reign of Alfred. This, how-
ever, is but conjecture 1 still, whether it be so, or whether it be a wreck of
some Danish pirates, it must have lain there many centuries. (Lit. Re .)
Sir Joseph Banks recorda, in the Journal of Sciens-e (vol. i. p. 244), the ol-
lowing account of 88 ancient 88808 found in Lincolnshire in April, 1816, at
8 de th of 8 ft. under the sui-face, in cutting a drain parallel with the river
witham, about two miles east of Lincoln, between that city and Horsley
Deep. lt seems hollowed out of an oak ιιι-881 lt is 30 st. Sin. long, and mea-
sures 3 st. broad in the widest part. The thickness of the bottom is between 7 in.
and Sin. Another similar canoe was discovered in cutting a drain near
Horsley Deep; but it was unfortunately destroyed by the workmen before it
was ascertained what it was. Its length was nearly the same as the former,
but it was ἢ ft. wide. Resides these, three other canoes, resembling the above
in constructlon, have been found in the same county ε 088 18 8 asture near
the river Trent, not far from Gainsborough3 and two m cuttin 8 ain through
the fens below Lincoln. One of these is deposited in the ritish Museuin.
Gonjecture alone 888 88 indulged with r d to the probable age of these
three canoes5 but the fact of their being ho owed out of the trunks of old
trees must carry them back to a very early date, and establish their extreme
antiquity. Long before the time of Alfred, the Britons were familiar with
ships regularly built z vessels such as these are found only amongst the rudest
ple, and in the earliest stages of society3 8ηά the e och when any of the
&3¹- nations used such canoes must be remote in eed.” (Amoen. Quer.) -
The eetv of King E , however, appears to have consisted chiefly of boats3
and, though that of illiam the Conqueror, amounting to 900 vessels, with
which he invaded England in 1066, is said to have consisted of ships, the
